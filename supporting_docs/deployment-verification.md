# Production Deployment Verification

## Verification Date: 2025-08-27

### Production URL: https://ultrai-core.onrender.com

## Endpoints Tested

### 1. Health Check Endpoint
- **URL**: `https://ultrai-core.onrender.com/api/health`
- **Status**: ✅ 200 OK
- **Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "degraded",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-27T09:02:22.223414",
  "uptime": "3:49:16.984294",
  "environment": "production",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "services": {
    "database": "healthy",
    "cache": "healthy",
    "llm": "degraded"
  },
  "degraded_services": [
    "llm"
  ]
}
```
- **Notes**: System is running but LLM service is degraded (likely due to missing API keys)

### 2. API Documentation
- **URL**: `https://ultrai-core.onrender.com/docs`
- **Status**: ✅ 200 OK
- **Notes**: Swagger UI is accessible and loading correctly

### 3. Available Models Endpoint
- **URL**: `https://ultrai-core.onrender.com/api/available-models`
- **Status**: ✅ 200 OK
- **Response**: Successfully returns 14 available models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and HuggingFace
- **Models Available**:
  - OpenAI: gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, o1-preview, o1-mini
  - Anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet, claude-3-5-haiku, claude-3-sonnet
  - Google: gemini-2.0-flash-exp, gemini-1.5-pro, gemini-1.5-flash
  - HuggingFace: Llama-2, Llama-3, Mistral-7B, Qwen2.5

### 4. Orchestrator Endpoint
- **URL**: `POST https://ultrai-core.onrender.com/api/orchestrator/analyze`
- **Status**: ⚠️ 200 OK but with errors
- **Test Query**: "What is 2+2?"
- **Response**: The endpoint responds but returns an error indicating missing LLM responses
- **Error**: "Invalid input data structure - missing analysis"
- **Notes**: The orchestration pipeline is running but cannot get responses from LLMs (likely due to API key issues)

### 5. Frontend
- **URL**: `https://ultrai-core.onrender.com/`
- **Status**: ✅ 200 OK
- **Notes**: Frontend is being served correctly

## Summary

### Working Components:
- ✅ Core infrastructure is running
- ✅ API endpoints are accessible
- ✅ Database connection is healthy
- ✅ Cache (Redis) is healthy
- ✅ Frontend is served
- ✅ Model registry is populated

### Issues Identified:
- ⚠️ LLM service is in degraded state
- ⚠️ Orchestrator cannot get responses from LLM providers
- ⚠️ Likely missing or invalid API keys in production environment

### Post-Cleanup Status:
The recent codebase cleanup (84% size reduction) has NOT broken the core deployment. All infrastructure components are running correctly. The LLM service degradation appears to be a configuration issue rather than a code issue.

## Recommendations:
1. Verify API keys are properly set in Render environment variables
2. Check Render logs for specific LLM adapter errors
3. Test with mock mode to verify orchestration logic independent of LLM providers
