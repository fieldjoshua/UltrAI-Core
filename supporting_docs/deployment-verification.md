# Deployment Verification Log

## HuggingFace API Key Deployment - January 28, 2025

### Initial State (12:37 PM PST)
- **Deployment**: 7c624c0 (went live at 7:36 AM)
- **HuggingFace Status**: NOT CONFIGURED
- **Total Models**: 20 (should be 26 with HuggingFace)
- **API Key Added**: Yes (in Render dashboard)
- **Key**: [REDACTED â€“ configure via environment variable only]

### Issue
The HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY environment variable was added to Render dashboard but the deployment (7c624c0) that went live at 7:36 AM doesn't have access to it because:
1. Environment variables are only loaded when the service starts
2. Adding env vars in Render dashboard requires a new deployment to take effect

### Solution
Triggered new deployment with commit 41c1f5b5 "Deploy: activate HuggingFace models with API key" to force Render to restart the service and load the new environment variable.

### Status Updates

#### 12:41 PM PST
- Checked API status - HuggingFace still showing as not configured
- Current deployment (7c624c0) doesn't have the environment variable
- Waiting for new deployment to complete

### Verification Steps
1. Check API keys status: `curl https://ultrai-core.onrender.com/api/models/api-keys-status`
2. Verify HuggingFace is configured: Should show `"configured": true`
3. Check total models: Should increase from 20 to 26
4. Test a HuggingFace model through the orchestrator

### Expected Models After Deployment
