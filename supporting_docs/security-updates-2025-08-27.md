## GitHub Security Report Analysis

GitHub reported 61 vulnerabilities (6 critical, 18 high). However, our pip-audit scan only found 2 low-severity issues. This discrepancy could be due to:

1. GitHub scanning JavaScript dependencies in frontend (not covered by pip-audit)
2. GitHub scanning archived/old code that was recently removed
3. GitHub using a different vulnerability database
4. Some vulnerabilities may be in transitive dependencies not directly installed

## Recommendations

1. Run `npm audit` in the frontend directory to check JavaScript vulnerabilities
2. Keep monitoring GitHub security alerts
3. Set up automated dependency updates with Dependabot
4. Consider using `safety` or `bandit` for additional Python security scanning

## Dependencies Updated
- aiohttp: 3.12.13 → 3.12.14
- starlette: 0.40.0 → 0.47.2
- fastapi: 0.115.14 → 0.116.1 (for compatibility)
