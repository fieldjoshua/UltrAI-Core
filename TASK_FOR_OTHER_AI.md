# Task for Another AI: Security Vulnerabilities & Dependencies

## Priority: Fix Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. Review GitHub Security Alerts
- Visit: https://github.com/fieldjoshua/UltrAI-Core/security/dependabot
- Analyze the 10 vulnerabilities (1 high, 3 moderate, 6 low)
- Create a plan to address them in order of severity

### 2. Update Dependencies
```bash
# Check outdated packages
pip list --outdated
npm outdated

# Update critical security patches first
# Document any breaking changes
```

### 3. Create Security Fix Branch
```bash
git checkout -b security-fixes-2025-01
# Make fixes
# Test thoroughly
# Create PR with detailed notes
```

### 4. Document Changes
Create `SECURITY_FIXES_2025_01.md` with:
- List of vulnerabilities addressed
- Packages updated (before/after versions)
- Any breaking changes or required migrations
- Testing performed

### 5. Coordinate with Claude-1
- Claude-1 is working on staging verification
- Don't modify core functionality without coordination
- Focus on dependency updates that don't affect API behavior

## Notes
- The project uses both pip and npm dependencies
- Production uses `requirements-production.txt`
- Be careful with major version updates
- Test all changes locally before pushing
