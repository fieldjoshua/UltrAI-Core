# Health Check Fix Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Added Configuration to Skip API Calls** ✅
- Added `HEALTH_CHECK_SKIP_API_CALLS` environment variable
- When set to `true`, health checks only verify API key configuration without making actual API calls
- This prevents rate limiting issues in staging/development environments

### 2. **Updated Health Check Logic to Handle Rate Limiting** ✅
- Modified `health_service.py` to treat rate-limited providers as "functional"
- Service now shows as "healthy" if at least one provider is available OR rate-limited
- Rate-limited providers are tracked separately from failed providers

### 3. **Created Comprehensive Test Suite** ✅
- Added `test_health_check_behavior.py` for health check logic
- Added `test_correct_endpoints.py` for endpoint verification
- Tests verify:
  - Rate-limited providers don't cause degraded status
  - API call skipping works correctly
  - Correct endpoint paths are used

## How to Deploy These Changes

### 1. Set Environment Variables for Staging
```bash
# In Render dashboard for staging:
HEALTH_CHECK_SKIP_API_CALLS=true
HEALTH_CHECK_CACHE_TTL=300  # 5 minutes cache
```

### 2. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add app/utils/health_check.py app/services/health_service.py tests/
git commit -m "Fix health check to handle rate limiting gracefully

- Add HEALTH_CHECK_SKIP_API_CALLS option
- Treat rate-limited providers as functional
- Add comprehensive test coverage"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Verify After Deployment
```bash
# Check health status
curl https://ultrai-staging-api.onrender.com/api/health

# Should show "healthy" even if OpenAI is rate-limited
```

## Correct API Endpoints Reference

### ✅ Correct Endpoints
- `GET /api/health` - Health check
- `GET /api/available-models` - List models
- `GET /api/models/health` - Model service health
- `POST /api/orchestrator/analyze` - Main orchestration (requires auth)
- `GET /api/orchestrator/health` - Orchestrator health
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Authentication

### ❌ Wrong Endpoints (Don't Exist)
- `/api/models` → Use `/api/available-models`
- `/api/model-health` → Use `/api/models/health`
- `/api/orchestrate` → Use `/api/orchestrator/analyze`

## Testing Guide

### Run Unit Tests
```bash
# Test health check behavior
pytest tests/unit/test_health_check_behavior.py -v

# Test endpoint paths
pytest tests/integration/test_correct_endpoints.py -v
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test with skip flag
HEALTH_CHECK_SKIP_API_CALLS=true pytest tests/unit/test_health_service.py -v

# Test staging endpoints
./scripts/test-staging-correct.sh
```

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Authentication Endpoint (405 Error)
The `/api/auth/login` endpoint is correctly defined to accept POST in the code, but returns 405 in staging. This might be:
- A deployment issue
- CORS or middleware interference
- The endpoint might not be registered properly in the staging build

### 2. Separate API Keys Needed
To fully resolve rate limiting:
- Use different OpenAI API keys for staging vs production
- Or implement request queuing/caching for health checks

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **No More False "Degraded" Status** - Rate limiting won't mark service as unhealthy
2. **Reduced API Costs** - Health checks can skip actual API calls
3. **Better Monitoring** - Distinguishes between rate limiting and real failures
4. **Improved Testing** - Comprehensive test coverage for health check behavior

## Next Steps

1. Deploy these changes to staging
2. Monitor health status after deployment
3. If still showing degraded, check Render logs for specific errors
4. Consider implementing health check result caching to further reduce API calls
