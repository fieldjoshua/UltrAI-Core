# Documentation Migration Registry

This registry tracks documentation that has been migrated from ACTION directories to the main documentation system.

## Purpose

The Documentation Migration Registry serves several purposes:

1. Maintains a historical record of documentation migrations
2. Provides traceability from documentation back to originating ACTIONS
3. Helps identify patterns in documentation creation and migration
4. Assists in documentation audits and quality assessments
