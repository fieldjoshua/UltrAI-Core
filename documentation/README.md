## Core Components

### Analysis Patterns

UltraAI uses a collection of specialized "analysis patterns" (also called "feathers") to combine multiple LLM responses in intelligent ways. These patterns each represent a different approach to intelligence multiplication.

For detailed information about analysis patterns:

1. **Technical Implementation**: See `instructions/PATTERNS.md` for the definitive reference on pattern structure and implementation
2. **Conceptual Overview**: See `logic/INTELLIGENCE_MULTIPLICATION.md` for detailed explanations of each pattern's methodology and use cases

### Key Documentation Files

- `instructions/PATTERNS.md`: The technical reference for pattern implementation
- `logic/INTELLIGENCE_MULTIPLICATION.md`: The conceptual guide to pattern methodologies
- `instructions/ANALYSIS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`: Troubleshooting guide for analysis issues

## Getting Started

If you're new to UltraAI, start by reading:

1. The main `README.md` at the project root
2. `logic/README_NEW_STRUCTURE.md` for an overview of the system architecture
3. `logic/INTELLIGENCE_MULTIPLICATION.md` to understand the analysis patterns

## Contributing to Documentation

When contributing to documentation:

1. Place technical implementation details in `instructions/`
2. Place conceptual explanations in `logic/`
3. Update this README when adding new documentation files
4. Maintain cross-references between related documentation
