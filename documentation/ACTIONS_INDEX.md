# UltraAI Actions Index

> **Visualizer-Ready**: This file is parsed by the UltraAI Visualizer. Do not change column headers. Maintain consistent formatting to ensure parsing is successful.

This document serves as the dashboard for all actions in the UltraAI Framework. It provides a snapshot of current work, recent activities, and completed actions.

## Core Principle: Every Action Must Have a Plan

The UltraAI Framework operates on the fundamental principle that **every action must have a plan**:

- All substantive work is defined as an action
- Each action requires a formal, documented plan before implementation begins
- All active actions must be listed in this index
- Action plans are stored in the Actions directory with the action name (e.g., API_DEVELOPMENT)
- No substantive work can proceed without being listed here as an action with a corresponding plan

This ensures that all development efforts are well-considered, properly documented, and coordinated with other activities.

## Getting Started

If you're new to the project:

1. Review this index to understand current actions and priorities
2. Read the [RULES.md](RULES.md) for project rules and standards
3. Examine the active actions that interest you and their implementation plans
4. Read the [CONFIG_DEFINITIONS.md](CONFIG_DEFINITIONS.md) for architecture and dependencies

## How to Use This Index

This index is updated:

- When new actions are identified
- When action status changes
- When significant milestones are reached

To propose new actions or update existing ones, follow the process in [RULES.md](RULES.md).
