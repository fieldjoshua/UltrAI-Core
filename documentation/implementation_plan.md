# Production Readiness Implementation Plan

This document outlines the necessary steps to complete the production readiness implementation for Ultra.

## Current Status

The implementation has been completed with the following features:
- Toggle between development (mock) and production modes
- Run with proper environment configuration
- Handle authentication correctly in production mode
- Test system functionality in a production environment
- Provide workarounds for incomplete endpoints

Several issues remain to be addressed:

1. **Available Models Endpoint**: Not working in production mode (404)
2. **API Endpoints Authorization**: Some endpoints need authorization adjustments
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite for production mode
4. **API Key Handling**: Secure management of provider API keys

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Fix Available Models Endpoint (High Priority)

- [ ] Debug the `/api/available-models` endpoint in production mode
- [ ] Ensure LLM registry is properly initialized in production
- [ ] Add fallback behavior for missing models
- [ ] Implement caching for model information

Tasks:
```
1. Check route registration in app.py
2. Verify llm_config_service initialization in production mode
3. Update llm_router to handle production environment
4. Test endpoint with X-Test-Mode header
```

### 2. Add Support for Real LLM Services (High Priority)

- [x] Implement proper API key validation for production
- [x] Create mechanism to test with real API keys
- [x] Add health checks for LLM provider connectivity
- [x] Add circuit breaker for provider failures

Tasks:
```
1. ✅ Create .env.api_keys file for storing provider API keys
2. ✅ Update test_production.sh to use real API keys when available
3. ✅ Add documentation for testing with real providers
4. ✅ Create LLM provider health check endpoints
5. ✅ Implement circuit breaker for LLM providers
6. ✅ Add monitoring for provider health status
7. Implement API key rotation mechanism
8. Add monitoring for API usage and quotas
```

### 3. Enhance Authentication System (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Complete JWT token validation for all secured endpoints
- [ ] Add role-based access control
- [ ] Implement API key authorization for service-to-service communication
- [ ] Add audit logging for authentication events

Tasks:
```
1. Update auth middleware to support roles
2. Create authorization utility functions
3. Implement test tokens for testing
4. Add comprehensive auth test suite
```

### 4. Improve Testing Framework (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Enhance the test_production.sh script
- [ ] Add production-specific integration tests
- [ ] Create test fixtures for production environment
- [ ] Add parallelized test execution

Tasks:
```
1. Create separate test modules for production-specific tests
2. Add support for test data generation
3. Implement test fixtures for authentication
4. Add test coverage reporting
```

### 5. Create Documentation (Low Priority)

- [ ] Complete production deployment guide
- [ ] Document environment configuration requirements
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Add API documentation for production endpoints

Tasks:
```
1. Update API documentation
2. Create production deployment checklist
3. Document environment variables
4. Create user guide for production features
```

## Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Fix available models endpoint and enhance API key handling
2. **Week 2**: Implement authentication improvements and testing framework
3. **Week 3**: Complete documentation and final testing

## Dependencies

- Access to cloud LLM provider accounts for testing
- Docker environment for production-like testing
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## Success Criteria

- All critical endpoints (health, analyze, models) return 200 OK in production mode
- Authentication works correctly with both test tokens and real tokens
- Test suite passes in production environment
- Documentation is complete and accurate
