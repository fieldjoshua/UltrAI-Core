# Implementation Plans

This directory contains detailed plans outlining the specific steps to build and implement each phase of the UltraAI project development.

## Purpose

The documents in this directory focus on:

- Outlining specific, actionable steps to implement features
- Tracking implementation progress
- Providing concrete timelines and milestones
- Documenting the execution strategy for the project

## Documents

- **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**: Base implementation plan for Phase 1 of the project.
- **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PHASE2.md**: Implementation plan for Phase 2, focusing on modularizing the backend.
- **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PHASE3.md**: Implementation plan for Phase 3, focusing on database integration and enhanced error handling.
- **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PHASE4.md**: Implementation plan for Phase 4, focusing on frontend improvements.

- **MODULARIZATION_PLAN.md**: Detailed plan for modularizing the backend codebase, breaking down specific steps and code organization changes.

- **ROADMAP.md**: Overall implementation roadmap showing the phased approach to building and enhancing the system.
- **ULTRA_ROADMAP.md**: Extended roadmap with additional implementation details.

- **REFACTORING_PROGRESS.md**: Tracks the progress of implementation across all phases, showing which tasks are completed, in progress, or pending.

## Relationship to Logic Documentation

While the documents in this directory focus on *how* to build features step by step, the documents in the `logic` directory explain *why* those features are designed a certain way. Implementation plans execute upon the foundation and rationale provided by the logic documentation.
