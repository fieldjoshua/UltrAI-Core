Provisional Patent Application: UltrLLMOrchestrator System
Title of the Invention
UltrLLMOrchestrator System, Method, and Class for Advanced Multi-Modal Artificial Intelligence Symbiosis
Field of The Invention
This invention relates to the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP). Specifically, it concerns systems and methods for orchestrating interaction among multiple AI models to generate enhanced intelligent text-based processing, analyses, synthesis, and output. The invention addresses the user-centric experience and interaction with AI, seeking to maximize the efficacy of human/AI interaction by producing outputs that align with users' intended purposes. The system enables sophisticated coordination between different AI models through asynchronous processing and multi-stage refinement, creating a unified framework for enhanced analysis capabilities.
Background of the Invention
Artificial Intelligence emerged in 1956, but didn't breakthrough until the 2010s, enabled by increased computing power and large datasets. By the early 2020s, large language models (LLMs) and foundation models demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text, code, and multimedia content, marking the beginning of a new era in artificial intelligence with broad implications across industries.
By 2024, several companies had developed highly capable LLMs available as consumer-facing products. Users typically purchased access through monthly subscriptions and interacted with each LLM via its official user interface. These LLMs were trained using different data and different techniques, resulting in varied outputs even when given identical prompts.
However, these models lacked sophisticated orchestration capabilities that could utilize multiple AI models to process, analyze, and react to user inputs in a collaborative and amplifying manner. This limited the depth and breadth of multi-modal AI applications.
Current approaches to AI model integration face significant limitations. Traditional implementations typically process requests through single large language models or employ basic sequential combinations of models. This creates two fundamental problems: inefficient resource utilization and failure to leverage potential synergies between models. Existing solutions attempt to combine multiple models through simple aggregation or voting mechanisms, but lack sophisticated mechanisms for cross-model refinement and synthesis. The sequential processing of model responses leads to increased latency and reduced efficiency. Additionally, current systems fail to address the complex challenge of managing varying model capabilities, response times, and error conditions in a coordinated manner.
The invention was created to leverage the collective intelligence of multiple AI models to address user inquiries, commands, and challenges in real-time, applying individual AI models in unison to produce outputs that are better than those they would produce alone.
The tangible element of the invention is a Python-based system that directs a computer to activate individual LLMs while balancing hardware limitations and API restrictions to produce accurate, consistent, and well-rounded outputs that satisfy users' requirements.
To successfully apply the collective intelligence of multiple LLMs, the invention addresses central challenges including:
* Efficient coordination of multiple AI models
* API rate limiting
* Dynamic resource allocation
* Real-time performance optimization
* Robust error handling and recovery
* Adaptive learning from system behavior
* Efficient unified response creation
The UltrLLMOrchestrator System addresses these challenges with a flexible, scalable architecture that utilizes the best traits of multiple LLMs in concert, effectively multiplying the intelligence applied to solve a problem. It provides comprehensive understanding of input data, employs effective techniques to address broad problems collectively, and produces outputs that feature appropriate depth, factual accuracy, logical consistency, and contextually appropriate tone.
Description/Summary of the Invention
The UltrLLMOrchestrator is an AI orchestration system designed to integrate and manage the workflow of multiple AI generative models to collectively perform analysis, meta-analysis, and synthesis of data or textual prompts in an automated, cohesive process. This orchestration allows the multimodal system to perform more comprehensive and nuanced analyses than individual models could achieve alone.
The invention represents a novel approach to orchestrating multiple LLMs through an innovative multi-layer architecture that enables dynamic model selection, intelligent resource management, and adaptive optimization. The system uniquely combines multi-model orchestration, multi-layered analysis, resource management, and error handling to create a robust, efficient, and scalable solution for AI model management and execution. It introduces an innovative approach to initial response generation, meta-analysis, and synthesis across models, culminating in a hyper-level synthesis that draws unique insights by combining outputs in a structured manner.
The system implements asynchronous task distribution, allowing parallel model execution while maintaining coordinated output synthesis. This is achieved through template-based prompt management, exponential backoff retry mechanisms, and comprehensive logging systems.
The invention's primary innovation lies in its ability to enable dynamic interaction between multiple AI models, creating a coordinated system that exceeds the capabilities of its individual components through a structured yet flexible architecture that adapts to varying model capabilities and task requirements.
