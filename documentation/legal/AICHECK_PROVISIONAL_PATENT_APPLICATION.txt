Title: AICheck - Systematic Project Organization and Management Framework
Cross-Reference to Related Applications
[Not Applicable]
Field of the Invention
This invention relates to software development project management systems, specifically to the organization, documentation, and systematic management of complex AI-driven software development projects. The invention addresses the need for consistent documentation practices, structured project organization, standardized workflows, and systematic action tracking in AI-enhanced software development environments.
Background of the Invention
Modern software development, particularly for AI-enhanced applications, faces significant challenges in maintaining consistent documentation, organizing complex project structures, and ensuring systematic development workflows. Traditional project management tools often fail to address the unique challenges of AI-driven development, including the need for strict documentation practices, clear action organization, and robust workflow automation.

Existing project management approaches for AI development typically suffer from inconsistent organization, scattered or incomplete documentation, inadequate action tracking, and inefficient workflow processes. They lack unified frameworks for documentation-first development, standardized directory structures, and automated session management for AI-assisted development. As a result, organizations face challenges in maintaining development quality, tracking progress, and efficiently integrating AI capabilities into their development workflows.

There is a critical need for a system that:
* Implements strict documentation-first principles for all development activities.
* Provides structured, standardized project organization with clear separation of concerns.
* Enables systematic action-based development with robust tracking and status management.
* Automates workflow processes for AI-assisted development sessions.
* Enforces consistent development practices and style requirements.
* Facilitates rapid onboarding of new developers through comprehensive documentation and organization.
Summary of the Invention
The present invention, AICheck, is a comprehensive project organization and management framework designed specifically for complex AI-driven software development projects. AICheck enables developers, teams, and organizations to:
* Implement documentation-first principles by enforcing comprehensive documentation before any implementation work.
* Organize projects using a standardized, hierarchical directory structure with clear separation of concerns.
* Manage development through discrete, well-defined actions with systematic tracking and status management.
* Automate development workflows through scripted session management tools and standardized processes.
* Enforce consistent style requirements and development practices across all project components.
* Onboard new developers quickly through comprehensive documentation and clear project organization.

Key innovations and advantages include:
* Documentation-first architecture: The system enforces comprehensive documentation before implementation, with specialized directories for different documentation types and clear relationships to implementation components.
* Standardized project structure: A comprehensive, hierarchical directory structure organizes all project components by function and purpose, improving navigability and maintainability.
* Action-based development management: Development tasks are organized as discrete actions with detailed plans, clear objectives, and systematic status tracking.
* Session-based workflow automation: Scripted tools automate the starting, managing, and documenting of development sessions, ensuring consistent practices.
* Integrated rules enforcement: The system maintains a central rules document that serves as the controlling reference for all development activities, ensuring adherence to project standards.
* Developer-centric design: Comprehensive documentation, clear organization, and automated workflows support rapid developer onboarding and consistent practices.
* Flexible extension system: The framework is designed to be adaptable to different project types and development environments while maintaining core principles.

AICheck's architecture is illustrated in Figure 1 (System Architecture) and Figure 2 (Directory Structure), which highlight the framework's organization, workflow, and integration capabilities.

* Maintains dependencies and relationships between actions.
* Enforces single active action workflow to ensure focused development.
2.3 Session Management Framework
* Provides scripted tools for starting, managing, and documenting development sessions.
* Automates context capturing and session record maintenance.
* Implements command-line utilities for checking status, generating prompts, and managing actions.
* Ensures consistent session workflows and documentation.
2.4 Rules and Standards System
* Maintains a central RULES.md document as the controlling reference for all development.
* Defines project structure, documentation requirements, and development practices.
* Provides guidelines for style, commits, and process workflows.
* Serves as the authoritative reference for resolving questions and conflicts.
2.5 Directory Structure System
* Implements a standardized, hierarchical directory structure organized by function and concern.
* Maintains clear separation between documentation, source code, and supporting resources.
* Organizes AICheck components in a dedicated directory with specialized subdirectories.
* Provides navigation aids and reference documents for improved discoverability.
