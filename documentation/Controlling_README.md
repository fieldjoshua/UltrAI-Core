# UltraAI Framework

## Project Overview

The UltraAI Framework is a comprehensive platform for orchestrating and coordinating multiple AI models to achieve enhanced analytical capabilities. The framework enables different collaboration patterns between models, creating a system that can generate more insightful, nuanced, and reliable outputs than any single model operating independently.

## Core Philosophy

UltraAI is built on the principle of **Intelligence Multiplication** - the idea that properly coordinated AI models can achieve multiplicative effects rather than merely additive improvements. By implementing structured collaboration patterns, careful prompt engineering, and intelligent result synthesis, UltraAI creates a system that is greater than the sum of its parts.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Model Orchestration**: Coordinate multiple AI models from different providers
- **Collaboration Patterns**: Implement debate, consensus, specialized roles, and other patterns
- **Document Analysis**: Process and analyze documents to provide context-aware responses
- **Analysis Workflow**: Step-by-step guided process for complex analytical tasks
- **Flexible Integration**: Use as a standalone application or integrate with existing systems

## Documentation Principles

The UltraAI Framework follows these documentation principles:

1. **Single Source of Truth**: This README and the Controlling_GUIDELINES.md serve as the authoritative source for all aspects of the project. The ACTIONS_INDEX.md tracks all active development efforts.

2. **Plan-Based Action Model**:
   - Every action must have a plan
   - No substantive work can begin without a corresponding action and implementation plan
   - All actions must be registered in the ACTIONS_INDEX.md
   - All implementation plans must follow the PLAN_TEMPLATE.md format

3. **Template-Driven Documentation**: All documentation follows established templates to ensure consistency and completeness.

4. **Change Management**: New actions must be reviewed against existing actions in ACTIONS_INDEX.md, and all changes must reference the authorizing action and its implementation plan.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- Python (v3.9 or higher)
- Access to AI model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ultraai.git
cd ultraai

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file with your API keys:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
```

### Running the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Development Roadmap

The development of UltraAI is guided by the following roadmap:

1. **Core Infrastructure**: API development, backend integration, frontend UI
2. **Model Integration**: Connect to various AI providers and implement patterns
3. **Document Processing**: Add document handling and analysis capabilities
4. **Advanced Features**: Implement specialized workflows and templates
5. **Deployment and Scaling**: Optimize for production use

## Documentation Authority

### Authority Hierarchy

1. **Controlling_GUIDELINES.md and Controlling_README.md** have ultimate authority over all aspects of the project.
2. **ACTIONS_INDEX.md** defines all authorized work.
3. **Individual Plans** derive authority from approval documented in ACTIONS_INDEX.md.
4. **Supporting Documents** need to reference and align with their parent plan.

### Approval Requirements

1. **All new plans** must be explicitly approved by Joshua Field before implementation.
2. **All new actions** must be explicitly approved by Joshua Field before being added to ACTIONS_INDEX.md.
3. **Any significant changes to existing plans** must be explicitly approved by Joshua Field before implementation.
4. **Documentation of approval** must be recorded in the relevant plan document and in ACTIONS_INDEX.md.
5. **Implicit approval**: The editor may assume Joshua Field's approval for changes and implementations unless explicitly stated otherwise.

### Conflict Resolution

When conflicts arise between documents:

- Controlling documents take precedence over plans
- More recent plans take precedence over older plans
- Parent plans take precedence over child plans

All team members are responsible for maintaining this hierarchy and resolving conflicts proactively.

## Contributing

1. Review the [Controlling_GUIDELINES.md](Controlling_GUIDELINES.md) for documentation standards
2. Check the [ACTIONS_INDEX.md](ACTIONS_INDEX.md) for current priorities
3. Create or update plans following the established templates
