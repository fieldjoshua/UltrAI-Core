| `perspective` | Focuses on different analytical perspectives and integration | Examines a question from multiple analytical perspectives | Minor wording differences |
| `scenario` | Analyzes responses through different scenarios and conditions | Explores potential future outcomes and alternative possibilities | Minor wording differences |
| `stakeholder` | Analyzes from multiple stakeholder perspectives | Analyzes from multiple stakeholder perspectives to reveal diverse interests and needs | Conceptual has more detail |
| `systems` | Maps complex system dynamics with feedback loops | Maps complex system dynamics with feedback loops and leverage points | Conceptual adds "leverage points" |
| `time` | Analyzes across multiple time frames | Analyzes across multiple time frames to balance short and long-term considerations | Conceptual has more detail |
| `innovation` | Uses cross-domain analogies to discover non-obvious patterns | Uses cross-domain analogies to discover non-obvious patterns and solutions | Conceptual adds "solutions" |

## Recommendations

### Technical Documentation Enhancements

1. **Add Process Descriptions**:
   - Update PATTERNS.md to include the full process flow for each pattern (Initial → Meta → Hyper → Ultra)
   - Include sample instructions/templates for each stage

2. **Add Use Cases**:
   - Add recommended use cases to PATTERNS.md for each pattern
   - Include example scenarios for when each pattern is most effective

3. **Improve Cross-Referencing**:
   - Add explicit references to INTELLIGENCE_MULTIPLICATION.md for conceptual details
   - Include references to actual code implementations

### Conceptual Documentation Enhancements

1. **Improve Code References**:
   - Add full paths to referenced implementation files
   - Include reference to API mapping in `backend/routes/analyze_routes.py`

2. **Add Technical Details**:
   - Include information about implementation structure
   - Reference the pattern structure as defined in PATTERNS.md

3. **Standardize Descriptions**:
   - Align description wording more closely with technical documentation
   - Ensure consistent terminology between both documents

### Implementation Strategy

1. Create new "unified pattern documentation" that serves both technical and conceptual needs
2. Ensure all patterns follow the same documentation structure
3. Add cross-references between technical and conceptual aspects
4. Verify alignment with actual code implementation
