# ULTRAI IMPLEMENTATION PLAN - PHASE 2

This document outlines the detailed steps to implement Phase 2 of our refactoring roadmap, focusing on modularizing the backend code.

## Goals

- Break down large Python files into smaller, more maintainable modules
- Follow the structure outlined in MODULARIZATION_PLAN.md
- Ensure all functionality continues to work after refactoring
- Improve code organization and maintainability

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Create Directory Structure

- [ ] Create necessary directories in backend:
  - [ ] `backend/models/` - For Pydantic data models
  - [ ] `backend/api/routes/` - For API route handlers
  - [ ] `backend/utils/` - For utility functions
  - [ ] `backend/services/` - For business logic services

### 2. Extract Models

- [ ] Create model files in `backend/models/`:
  - [ ] `document.py` - Document-related models
  - [ ] `analysis.py` - Analysis-related models
  - [ ] `pricing.py` - Pricing-related models
  - [ ] `user.py` - User-related models
  - [ ] `__init__.py` - Package exports

### 3. Extract Utilities

- [ ] Create utility files in `backend/utils/`:
  - [ ] `caching.py` - Caching utilities
  - [ ] `file_utils.py` - File handling utilities
  - [ ] `metrics_utils.py` - Metrics calculation utilities
  - [ ] `__init__.py` - Package exports

### 4. Extract Services

- [ ] Create service files in `backend/services/`:
  - [ ] `document_processor.py` - Document processing service
  - [ ] `llm_service.py` - LLM orchestration service
  - [ ] `pricing_service.py` - Pricing calculation service
  - [ ] `metrics_service.py` - System metrics collection
  - [ ] `__init__.py` - Package exports

### 5. Extract Routes

- [ ] Create route files in `backend/api/routes/`:
  - [ ] `analyze.py` - Analysis-related endpoints
  - [ ] `documents.py` - Document processing endpoints
  - [ ] `health.py` - Health check endpoints
  - [ ] `metrics.py` - System metrics endpoints
  - [ ] `pricing.py` - Pricing-related endpoints
  - [ ] `users.py` - User account endpoints
  - [ ] `__init__.py` - Package exports

### 6. Refactor Main App

- [ ] Simplify `main.py` to:
  - [ ] Import components from modular files
  - [ ] Register routes from route modules
  - [ ] Configure middleware and app settings
  - [ ] Set up dependency injection

## Testing Strategy

After each extraction, verify:

- [ ] Run the app to ensure functionality
- [ ] Run tests to ensure nothing is broken
- [ ] Fix any import errors or other issues
- [ ] Document changes made

## Implementation Order

For each component type (models, utils, services, routes):

1. Create the directory if it doesn't exist
2. Extract the simplest components first
3. Update imports in main.py and other files
4. Test functionality after each extraction
5. Move on to more complex components

## Progress Tracking

### Directory Structure

- [ ] Created `backend/models/`
- [ ] Created `backend/api/routes/`
- [ ] Created `backend/utils/`
- [ ] Created `backend/services/`

### Extracted Models

- [ ] `models/document.py`
- [ ] `models/analysis.py`
- [ ] `models/pricing.py`
- [ ] `models/user.py`
- [ ] `models/__init__.py`

### Extracted Utilities

- [ ] `utils/caching.py`
- [ ] `utils/file_utils.py`
- [ ] `utils/metrics_utils.py`
- [ ] `utils/__init__.py`

### Extracted Services

- [ ] `services/document_processor.py`
- [ ] `services/llm_service.py`
- [ ] `services/pricing_service.py`
- [ ] `services/metrics_service.py`
- [ ] `services/__init__.py`

### Extracted Routes

- [ ] `api/routes/analyze.py`
- [ ] `api/routes/documents.py`
- [ ] `api/routes/health.py`
- [ ] `api/routes/metrics.py`
- [ ] `api/routes/pricing.py`
- [ ] `api/routes/users.py`
- [ ] `api/routes/__init__.py`

### Refactored Main App

- [ ] Simplified `main.py`
