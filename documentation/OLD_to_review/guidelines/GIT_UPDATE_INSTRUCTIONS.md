# Git Update Instructions

Since we're having issues with terminal commands, here are the manual steps to track and reflect changes in your Git repository:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the Ultra project directory:

   ```
   cd /Users/joshuafield/Documents/Ultra
   ```

2. Check the status of changes:

   ```
   git status
   ```

3. Add the modified files:

   ```
   git add documentation/guidelines/*.md
   git add documentation/instructions/*.md
   git add documentation/*.md
   ```

4. Commit the changes:

   ```
   git commit -m "Update documentation: Consolidated documentation files and updated Documentation Index"
   ```

5. Push the changes:

   ```
   git push
   ```
