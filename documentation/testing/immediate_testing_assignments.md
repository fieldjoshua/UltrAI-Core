   curl -N -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
     "https://ultrai-staging-api.onrender.com/api/orchestrator/events?correlation_id=aux-test-$(date +%s)" &
   
   # Run analysis in another terminal while monitoring
   ```

#### **Expected Outcomes**:
- [ ] Error summary shows healthy provider states
- [ ] 503 responses include proper provider details
- [ ] SSE events follow standardized schema
- [ ] Error monitoring endpoints respond correctly
