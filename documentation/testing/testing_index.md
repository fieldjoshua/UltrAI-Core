# Ultra Testing Index

## Overview

This document serves as the central index for all testing-related documentation in the Ultra project. It provides an organized overview of testing strategies, methodologies, and resources available for different environments.

## Testing Environment Types

Ultra supports testing in two primary environments:

1. **Development Environment Testing** - Testing with mock services and simulated responses for rapid iteration and development
2. **Production Environment Testing** - Testing with real API services and actual LLM providers for production validation

## Testing Documentation

### Core Testing Documents

- [Development vs. Production Testing](mock_vs_real_testing.md) - Comprehensive guide for testing in different environments
- [Test Configuration Guide](../configuration/environment_variables.md) - Configuration settings for different test environments
- [Scripts Documentation](../scripts/testing_scripts.md) - Documentation for test scripts and automation

### Test Types

#### Unit Tests

- Unit Test Framework - Testing individual components in isolation
- Mock Service Strategies - Creating effective mocks for unit testing
- Unit Test Patterns - Common patterns for unit test implementation

#### Integration Tests

- API Integration Tests - Testing API endpoints and services
- Database Integration - Testing database interactions
- Service Integration - Testing service interactions and dependencies

#### End-to-End Tests

- User Flow Testing - Testing complete user flows and scenarios
- System Integration Testing - Testing the full system as integrated components
- Performance and Load Testing - Testing system performance under load

### Environment-Specific Testing

#### Development Environment

- Mock Service Configuration - Setting up mock services for development testing
- Rapid Iteration Testing - Fast testing cycles for development
- Local Development Testing - Testing in local development environments

#### Production Environment

- API Provider Testing - Testing with actual LLM API providers
- Authentication Testing - Testing with real authentication
- Pre-Deployment Validation - Final verification before deployment

## Testing Scripts and Tools

- `run_tests.sh` - Script for running tests in the development environment
- `test_production.sh` - Script for testing in the production environment
- `toggle_environment.sh` - Script for switching between development and production environments

## Best Practices

- Test Data Management - Strategies for managing test data
- Test Coverage - Guidelines for maintaining test coverage
- Continuous Integration - Integrating tests into CI/CD pipelines

## Troubleshooting

- Common Testing Issues - Solutions for frequently encountered testing problems
- Environment-Specific Troubleshooting - Addressing issues in specific environments
- Debugging Strategies - Approaches for debugging test failures

## Recent Updates

- **Development vs. Production Testing Guide** - Updated terminology and approach for environment-specific testing
- **Environment Toggle Script** - New script for easily switching between environments
- **Production Testing Script** - Dedicated script for testing in the production environment
