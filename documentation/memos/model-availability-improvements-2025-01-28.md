# Memo: Model Availability Improvements - January 28, 2025

## To: All Developers
## From: Claude
## Date: January 28, 2025
## Subject: Enhanced Model Availability with API Key Checking

### Summary
Implemented smart model availability that only shows models with configured API keys, preventing user confusion and failed requests.

### Key Changes

1. **API Key-Based Filtering**
   - `/api/available-models` now only returns models that have API keys configured
   - Users only see models they can actually use
   - Prevents selection of unavailable models in the UI

2. **Expanded Model Support**
   - **OpenAI** (8 models): Added gpt-4-turbo-preview, gpt-3.5-turbo-16k
   - **Anthropic** (6 models): Added claude-3-opus, full version names
   - **Google** (6 models): Added gemini-1.5-pro-latest, gemini-1.5-flash-latest
   - **HuggingFace** (6 models): Added Llama-3-70B, Mixtral-8x7B, Gemma-7B, Microsoft Phi-2

3. **New Endpoints**
   - `/api/models/providers-summary` - Shows which providers are configured and model counts
   - `/api/models/api-keys-status` - Checks API key configuration without exposing keys

### Current Status in Production
- ✅ OpenAI: Configured (8 models available)
- ✅ Anthropic: Configured (6 models available)  
- ✅ Google: Configured (6 models available)
- ❌ HuggingFace: Not configured (0 models available)
- **Total**: 20 models available out of 26 possible

### For Frontend Team
The other editor will update Step 3 of the wizard to:
- Fetch available models from `/api/available-models`
- Only display models that are returned (have API keys)
- Remove hardcoded model lists

### Testing the Changes
```bash
# Check available models (only shows those with API keys)
curl https://ultrai-core.onrender.com/api/available-models

# Check provider summary
curl https://ultrai-core.onrender.com/api/models/providers-summary

# Check API key status
curl https://ultrai-core.onrender.com/api/models/api-keys-status
```

### Benefits
1. **Better UX**: Users can't select models that won't work
2. **Clearer errors**: When a model fails, we know it's not due to missing API keys
3. **More options**: 26 total models supported (20 currently available)
4. **Dynamic**: As API keys are added/removed, available models update automatically
