### Analysis Patterns

UltrAI's analysis patterns (feathers) for intelligence multiplication are documented in two primary files:

- **[INTELLIGENCE_MULTIPLICATION.md](logic/INTELLIGENCE_MULTIPLICATION.md)**: User-facing documentation

| Gut Check Analysis | Relies on LLM intuition while considering other responses | Quick decisions, time-sensitive analysis |
| Confidence Analysis | Analyzes responses with confidence scoring | Identifying reliable answers, deciding between competing solutions |
| Critique Analysis | Models critically evaluate each other's reasoning | Identifying flaws, stress-testing solutions |
| Fact Check Analysis | Verifies factual accuracy and cites sources | Research, historical analysis, scientific evaluation |
| Perspective Analysis | Examines a question from multiple analytical perspectives | Complex multi-dimensional problems |
| Scenario Analysis | Explores potential future outcomes | Planning, risk assessment, strategic foresight |
| Stakeholder Vision | Analyzes from multiple stakeholder perspectives | Policy development, product design, negotiation |
| Systems Mapper | Maps complex system dynamics with feedback loops | Complex problems, policy design, organizational change |
| Time Horizon | Analyzes across multiple time frames | Strategic planning, investment decisions |
| Innovation Bridge | Uses cross-domain analogies to discover non-obvious solutions | Creative problem-solving, innovation |
