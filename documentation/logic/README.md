# Logic Documentation

This directory contains design documents that explain the reasoning and rationale behind features and architectural decisions in the UltraAI project.

## Purpose

The documents in this directory focus on:

- Explaining *why* certain design decisions were made
- Describing the architectural concepts and principles
- Documenting the reasoning behind feature implementations
- Providing conceptual models of system components

## Documents

- **INTELLIGENCE_MULTIPLICATION.md**: Explains the core AI architecture and orchestration approach, including the conceptual model of how multiple LLMs work together to achieve better results.

- **backend_PARAMETER_MANAGEMENT.md**: Describes the reasoning behind the AI model parameter configuration system, explaining why certain parameters were chosen and how they affect the system.

- **backend_README_PRICING_UPDATER.md**: Details the design rationale for the pricing system, explaining the concepts behind pricing models and update mechanisms.

- **README_NEW_STRUCTURE.md**: Outlines the reasoning behind the new project structure, explaining why certain organizational decisions were made.

## Relationship to Implementation Plans

While the documents in this directory explain *why* features were designed in a certain way, the documents in the `implementation_plans` directory focus on *how* to build those features step by step. Logic documentation provides the foundation and rationale that implementation plans execute upon.
