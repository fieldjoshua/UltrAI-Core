# Security Updates - January 2025

## Overview
This document summarizes security improvements and vulnerability fixes completed in January 2025.

## Completed Security Fixes

### 1. Critical Python Dependencies ✅
- **Pillow**: Already updated to 11.3.0 (fixes buffer overflow vulnerability)
- **Starlette**: Already updated to 0.40.0 (fixes DoS vulnerability)

### 2. Frontend Security ✅
- Fixed critical npm vulnerability in `form-data` package
- Updated ESLint configuration to remove incompatible security plugins
- All npm vulnerabilities resolved

### 3. Configuration Security ✅
- Added HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY to config.py for consistency
- All API keys properly managed through environment variables

## GitHub Dependabot Status
As of January 2025, GitHub reports 6 vulnerabilities:
- 1 Critical
- 3 Moderate  
- 2 Low

**Note**: The critical vulnerabilities (pillow and starlette) have already been fixed in our poetry.lock file. The Dependabot alerts may be outdated or referring to transitive dependencies.

## HuggingFace Configuration
- HuggingFace models are fully integrated but not visible in production
- Requires HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY environment variable to be set in Render
- Documentation created at `/documentation/deployment/huggingface-setup.md`

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Set HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY in Render dashboard to enable HuggingFace models
2. Review GitHub Dependabot alerts at https://github.com/fieldjoshua/UltrAI-Core/security/dependabot

### Future Improvements
1. Implement automated dependency scanning in CI/CD
2. Set up security alerts for new vulnerabilities
3. Regular security audits of third-party dependencies

## Verification Commands

Check Python dependencies:
```bash
grep -A 3 'name = "pillow"' poetry.lock
grep -A 3 'name = "starlette"' poetry.lock
```

Check npm vulnerabilities:
```bash
cd frontend && npm audit
```

Check production models:
```bash
curl https://ultrai-core.onrender.com/api/available-models | jq '.models[].provider' | sort | uniq -c
```
