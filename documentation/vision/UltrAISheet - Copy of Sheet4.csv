ma,Ultra Synthesisâ„¢,Comprehensive intelligence integration,N/A,"Several of your fellow LLMs were given the same prompt as you. their responses are as follows. Do NOT assume that anything written is correct or properly sourced, but given these other responses, coukld you make your original response better? More insightful? more factual, more comprehensive when considerintg the initial user prompt? If you do believe you can make your original response better, please draft a new response to the initial inquiry [detiail th einquiry here]","To the chosen synthesizer: You are tasked with creating the Ultra Synthesis: a fully-integrated intelligence synthesis that combines the relevant outputs from all methods into a cohesive whole, with recommendations that benefit from multiple cognitive frameworks. The objective here is not to be necessarily the best, but the most expansive synthesization of the many outputs. While you should disregard facts or analyses that are extremely anonomylus or wrong, With the original prompt in mind [prompt here], your final Ultra Synthesis  should reflect all of thje relevant meat from the meta level resopnses, organized in a manner that is clear and non repetitive. ","Maximizes intelligence multiplication by leveraging the complementary strengths of different analytical approaches, resulting in insights and recommendations that no single method could produce"
