As of my last update in 2023, I can't directly retrieve or provide a real-time list of the top 10 peer-reviewed articles on the future of the economy in the context of the advent of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, I can guide you on how to find such articles and mention some key areas of focus and potential authors or journals that might be useful for your search.

### How to Find Peer-Reviewed Articles:
1. **Academic Databases**: To find peer-reviewed articles, you should explore academic databases such as Google Scholar, JSTOR, Pubmed (for bioeconomic implications), IEEE Xplore, and SSRN. Use keywords like "Artificial General Intelligence", "Economic Impact of AGI", "Future Economy and AGI", etc.

2. **University Library Access**: If you have access to a university library, use their online portal to access paid journals and conference proceedings.

3. **Academic Journals**: Directly accessing websites of reputable academic journals in economics and technology can yield specific studies. Journals like "Journal of Economic Perspectives", "Artificial Intelligence", and "Technological Forecasting and Social Change" often publish research on the intersection of technology and economic futures.

4. **Working Papers and Reports**: Institutions like the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) and the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) occasionally publish working papers that, while preliminary, offer cutting-edge insights into economic futures shaped by technologies like AGI.

### Potential Topics and Authors:
When looking for articles about the economic impact of AGI, consider these angles:
- **Labor Market and Automation**: Research might explore how AGI could transform jobs, skill demands, and wages.
- **Inequality**: Insights into how AGI might exacerbate or mitigate economic and social inequalities.
- **Policy and Regulation**: Examination of how governments might adapt policies related to technology, labor, and welfare in response to AGI.
- **Economic Growth**: Predictions on how AGI could influence productivity, innovation rates, and overall economic growth.
- **Ethical and Societal Impacts**: While not purely economic, understanding the ethical framework around AGI deployment is crucial for predicting its economic implications.

### Potential Authors and Thinkers:
- **Erik Brynjolfsson** and **Andrew McAfee**: Known for their work on the digital economy and how technological advancement impacts the economy.
- **Nick Bostrom**: While more of a philosopher, his insights into the implications of superintelligent AI could be highly relevant.
- **Eliezer Yudkowsky** and organizations like the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI) regularly explore the implications of advanced AI technologies.

### Conclusion:
While this response doesn't provide a direct list of articles, it aims to give you the tools and directions to find scholarly articles on the economic implications of AGI. The field is rapidly evolving, and staying current with the latest journals, conferences, and working papers is crucial for accessing the most recent research findings.
