**Provisional Patent Application**

**Title:** System for Orchestrating Multiple AI Models for Collaborative Analysis and Synthesis

**Inventors:** [Your Name]

**Filed:** [Date]

**Abstract**

The present invention provides a system for orchestrating multiple AI models to collaboratively analyze and synthesize information. The system enables the integration and coordination of different AI models, leveraging their collective capabilities to achieve improved insights and knowledge generation.

**Background**

Artificial intelligence (AI) models have made significant advancements in various domains, offering powerful capabilities for data analysis, decision-making, and knowledge discovery. However, most AI models are designed to perform specific tasks and often operate independently. This limitation can hinder the comprehensive analysis and synthesis of information that requires the combined capabilities of multiple models.

**Summary of the Invention**

The present invention addresses the limitations of existing AI systems by providing a framework for orchestrating multiple AI models to work collaboratively. The system leverages a centralized orchestrator that coordinates the interactions between individual models and manages the flow of information.

**Detailed Description**

The system comprises the following components:

* **Model Repository:** A central repository that stores and manages a collection of pre-trained AI models covering various domains and functionalities.
* **Orchestrator:** A central component that coordinates the collaboration between models. It receives input data and determines which models are best suited to perform the analysis.
* **Model Execution Engine:** An engine that executes the selected AI models in a parallel or sequential manner, depending on the nature of the task.
* **Analysis and Synthesis Module:** A module that combines the outputs from individual models and performs further analysis and synthesis to generate comprehensive insights and knowledge.
* **User Interface:** A user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the system, input data, and retrieve analysis results.

**Operation**

The system operates as follows:

1. The user inputs data and specifies the desired analysis requirements.
2. The orchestrator selects the most appropriate models from the repository based on the input data and analysis requirements.
3. The selected models are executed through the model execution engine.
4. The outputs from individual models are combined and analyzed in the analysis and synthesis module to generate comprehensive insights.
5. The final results are presented to the user through the user interface.

**Advantages**

The present invention offers several advantages over existing AI systems:

* **Enhanced Analysis Capabilities:** Combines the capabilities of multiple AI models to provide more comprehensive and accurate analysis.
* **Improved Knowledge Generation:** Exploits the collective knowledge of different models to generate novel insights and discover valuable information.
* **Increased Efficiency:** Orchestrates the execution of models to optimize performance and reduce the time required for analysis.
* **Flexibility and Scalability:** Allows the addition of new AI models to the repository as needed, enabling the system to adapt to evolving analysis requirements.

**Claims**
