**Technical Field**

The present invention relates to artificial intelligence (AI) orchestration systems and methods, particularly for processing and analyzing natural language prompts through multiple AI models.

**Background**

With the advent of powerful AI models such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Llama, the ability to harness the capabilities of multiple models has become increasingly desirable. However, challenges arise in coordinating and orchestrating these models, optimizing resource allocation, and ensuring seamless interaction.

**Summary of the Invention**

The present invention provides a novel AI orchestration system and methodology that addresses these challenges. It enables the orchestration of multiple AI models to enhance the processing and analysis of natural language prompts. The system employs a tiered approach, utilizing initial, meta, and ultra responses from various models to generate a comprehensive hyper-level synthesis.

**Detailed Description**

The orchestration system comprises three main processing stages:

**Stage 1: Initial Analysis**

The system initially distributes the prompt to a set of available AI models. Each model generates an initial response based on its unique capabilities and algorithms. These responses capture the individual insights and perspectives of each model.

**Stage 2: Meta-Analysis**

The initial responses are then provided as input to a second set of AI models. These models perform a meta-analysis, evaluating the initial responses and generating meta-responses that identify patterns, insights, and relationships across the initial responses.

**Stage 3: Ultra-Synthesis and Hyper-Synthesis**

The meta-responses are further processed by a third set of AI models, which generate ultra-responses. These responses combine the most valuable elements from each model at the meta-level, providing a comprehensive synthesis of the prompt. Finally, an ultra engine is used to generate a hyper-response, which encompasses a hyper-level synthesis that identifies novel perspectives and patterns visible only through the combined analysis of all the previous layers.
