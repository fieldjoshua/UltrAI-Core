Our model introduces adjustable, tiered monthly subscriptions tailored to individual attorneys and small practices, with rates set to outcompete current legal tech offerings at $50-500 monthly. Acknowledging the budget challenges typically encountered by public defenders, we're committed to furnishing discounted rates for public defender offices and our data-sharing collaborators, ensuring our tool's broad accessibility and adoption.
