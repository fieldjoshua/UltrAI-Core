PRIORITY,Strategy,Combined Plan & Details,Substantive Disagreements
1,Rotate Keys & Manage Secrets,"Rotate all exposed keys immediately (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, JWT_SECRET, etc.) and implement secret scanning in the CI/CD pipeline.",No substantive disagreement.
2,Enforce Authentication,"Set ENABLE_AUTH=true in production, protect admin endpoints behind auth, and implement refined rate limiting per user/API key.",No substantive disagreement.
3,Implement Resilience Patterns,Add circuit breakers for external APIs and use bounded retries with exponential backoff to handle transient errors gracefully.,No substantive disagreement.
4,Implement Structured Logging,Set up structured logging with PII scrubbing and end-to-end correlation IDs (X-Request-ID) to trace requests through the system.),No substantive disagreement.
5,Implement Response Streaming,Return incremental tokens and status updates to the user to keep the UX responsive during LLM processing.,"There is a technical disagreement. <br> • Plan 1 suggests implementing WebSocket support for live updates. <br> • Plan 2 recommends starting with the simpler Server-Sent Events (SSE), arguing WebSockets should only be used if full-duplex communication is truly necessary."
6,Add Cost Controls,"Implement token counting before a request is sent, provide a cost estimate, and enforce a cap per request or user.",No substantive disagreement.
7,Standardize Route Architecture,Fix the/api/api duplication issue and standardize all routes under a single /api prefix to improve architectural hygiene.,No substantive disagreement.
8,Automate CI/CD Testing,Add smoke tests for all OpenAPI endpoints and database connectivity tests to the CI/CD pipeline to ensure reliability before deployment.,No substantive disagreement.
9,Implement API Versioning,"Add a route versioning strategy (e.g., /api/v1/) to prepare for future changes.","There is a disagreement on its necessity. <br> • Plan 1 considers this a ""High Priority Fix"". <br> • Plan 2 argues that this is ""not urgent until you expose breaking external APIs"" and can be skipped for now."
