## Development Evolution

The interface designs evolved from visually rich, gradient-heavy layouts (Versions 1 and 5) toward more functional, streamlined interfaces (Versions 3 and 4), with Version 2 representing a middle ground that balances visual sophistication with usability.

The evolution demonstrates a shift in focus from creating a visually striking experience to optimizing for clarity and ease of use, while maintaining the core functionality of model selection, prompt input, and analysis configuration.
