**Field of the Invention:**

The present invention relates to the field of artificial intelligence, more specifically to an automated system designed to integrate and manage the workflow between multiple AI generative models for the analysis, meta-analysis, and synthesis of data or textual prompts in a cohesive process.

---

**Background of the Invention:**

In today's fast-paced digital world, the ability to quickly process, analyze, and generate insights from vast amounts of data is crucial. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) models have significantly advanced these capabilities. However, managing the workflow and integration among various AI generative models efficiently remains a complex challenge. There lacks a cohesive system that can automate the process of selecting, orchestrating, and synthesizing outputs from diverse AI models to produce comprehensive insights without extensive manual intervention.

---

**Summary of the Invention:**

The present invention aims to solve the aforementioned problems by providing an automated, integrated system designed for efficient workflow management among multiple AI generative models. This system seamlessly orchestrates the data flow between AI models, ensuring that data analysis, meta-analysis, and synthesis are conducted in a cohesive and timely manner. The system comprises a central management unit, a dynamic selection module, a workflow orchestration module, and a synthesis module, enabling end-to-end automation from data input to insights generation.

**Detailed Description of the Invention:**

1. **Central Management Unit (CMU):** The CMU acts as the core of the system, overseeing all operations. It receives input data or textual prompts and outputs the final synthesized insights. It manages user requests, system configurations, and model parameters.

2. **Dynamic Selection Module (DSM):** The DSM dynamically selects appropriate AI generative models based on the nature of the input data or textual prompt, intended analysis, available resources, and specific user requirements. It uses a sophisticated algorithm to evaluate model performance history, compatibility, and expected output quality.

3. **Workflow Orchestration Module (WOM):** The WOM orchestrates the process flow among the selected AI models. It automates the execution of tasks in sequence or in parallel, as required, handling data formatting, model feeding, and intermediate data storage. It ensures efficient task execution, minimal latency, and optimal resource utilization.

4. **Synthesis Module (SM):** The SM integrates and synthesizes the outputs from various AI models. It employs advanced techniques to consolidate findings, identify patterns, and generate comprehensive insights. It can produce reports, visualizations, and predictive analyses.

5. **User Interface (UI):** An intuitive UI allows users to input data/text, specify requirements, and receive synthesized outputs. It provides real-time updates on the processing status and access to intermediate outputs if desired.

6. **Security and Privacy Layer:** Ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and availability, this layer employs encryption, access control, and data anonymization techniques to protect sensitive information throughout the process.

**Operational Example:**

Imagine a user needs an in-depth analysis of social media trends based on specific keywords. Upon entering the requirements, the system selects AI models specialized in natural language processing for textual analysis and sentiment analysis. The workflow is orchestrated to first extract relevant posts, analyze sentiment, identify patterns, and finally synthesize a comprehensive report on emerging trends, all automatically and without manual model selection or data processing.

**Advantages of the Invention:**

- **Efficiency and Speed:** Automates and speeds up the workflow among multiple AI models, significantly reducing the time from data input to insights generation.
- **Scalability:** Easily accommodates additional AI models to enhance capabilities or update existing workflows.
- **Customization:** Tailors the analysis and synthesis process to specific user needs and data types.
- **Quality and Reliability:** Ensures high-quality, reliable insights by dynamically selecting and orchestrating the best-suited AI models for each task.
