As a healthy 44-year-old male looking to boost circulation and energy levels, there are several over-the-counter (OTC) supplements that may be beneficial for you. Here are some options you could consider adding to your regimen:

1. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): CoQ10 is an antioxidant that can help improve circulation and energy production in the body. It can also help reduce inflammation, which can contribute to fatigue and poor circulation.
2. L-Carnitine: L-Carnitine is an amino acid that plays a crucial role in energy production within cells. It can help transport fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they can be converted into energy. This can help improve circulation and overall energy levels.
3. Fish Oil: Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil have anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce inflammation throughout the body, including in the blood vessels. This can lead to improved circulation and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.
4. Vitamin D: Vitamin D is important for maintaining healthy bones, muscles, and nerves. It can also help improve immune function, which can reduce inflammation and promote overall well-being.
5. Ginkgo Biloba: Ginkgo biloba has been shown to improve blood flow to the brain and other parts of the body, leading to improved cognitive function and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.
6. Turmeric/Curcumin: Turmeric contains a compound called curcumin, which has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that can help improve circulation and reduce inflammation throughout the body.
7. Ginseng: Ginseng can help improve blood flow and reduce fatigue, making it a popular choice for those looking to boost energy levels.
8. Adaptogenic Herbs (such as Ashwagandha or Rhodiola): Adaptogenic herbs like ashwagandha and rhodiola can help the body adapt to stress and promote relaxation, leading to improved circulation and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.
9. Omega-7 fatty acids (found in Evening Primrose Oil): Omega-7 fatty acids found in evening primrose oil have been shown to improve blood flow and reduce inflammation throughout the body.
10. Probiotics: Probiotics can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for overall immune function and circulation.

It's important to note that while these supplements may be beneficial, they should not be used as a replacement for a healthy diet and lifestyle. Always consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.
