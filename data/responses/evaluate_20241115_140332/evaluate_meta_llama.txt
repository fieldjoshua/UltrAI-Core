**Detailed Description:**

The method for reversing binary integers according to the present invention comprises the following steps:

1. Converting an integer into its binary representation using the `bin()` function. This step is necessary to convert the integer into a binary string that can be manipulated using binary reversal techniques. The resulting binary string may have a leading "0b" prefix, which is removed in the next step.
2. Removing the leading "0b" prefix from the binary string. This step simplifies the binary representation of the integer and prepares it for reversal.
3. Reversing the resulting binary string using the `[::-1]` slice. This step flips the bits in the binary string, effectively reversing the order of the bits.
4. Converting the reversed binary string back to an integer using the `int()` function with a base of 2. This step converts the reversed binary string into its original integer value.
5. Returning the reversed integer. The final step returns the reversed integer, which can be used in various computing applications as needed.
