**Provisional Patent Application**

**Title:** System for Orchestrating Multiple AI Models for Collaborative Analysis and Synthesis

**Inventors:** [Your Name]

**Abstract**

The invention relates to a system that orchestrates multiple artificial intelligence (AI) models to collaboratively analyze and synthesize information. The system comprises a central controller that manages the execution of AI models and a data repository that stores input data and AI model outputs. The central controller assigns tasks to AI models based on their capabilities and the input data, and it monitors the progress of the AI models to ensure that they are performing as expected. The system also includes a feedback loop that allows AI models to provide feedback to each other, which can improve the accuracy and performance of the overall system.

**Background**

AI models are becoming increasingly powerful and are being used in a wider variety of applications. However, most AI models are designed to perform specific tasks and they are not always able to generalize to new situations. This can make it difficult to use AI models to solve complex problems that require a combination of different skills.

The invention addresses this problem by providing a system that can orchestrate multiple AI models to collaboratively analyze and synthesize information. The system allows AI models to share knowledge and expertise with each other, which can improve the accuracy and performance of the overall system.
