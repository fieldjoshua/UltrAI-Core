This description serves as a foundational overview for a provisional patent application concerning the described software system and method. Further details and enhancements could be elaborated upon subsequent to this initial submission.**Code:**

```
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load the image
image = cv2.imread('image.jpg')

# Convert the image to HSV color space
hsv = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)

# Create a mask for the blue color
blue_mask = cv2.inRange(hsv, (110, 100, 100), (130, 255, 255))

# Create a mask for the red color
red_mask = cv2.inRange(hsv, (0, 100, 100), (10, 255, 255))

# Combine the blue and red masks to get a mask for the colors we want to detect
mask = cv2.bitwise_or(blue_mask, red_mask)

# Apply the mask to the image to get the detected objects
detected_objects = cv2.bitwise_and(image, image, mask=mask)

# Display the detected objects
cv2.imshow('Detected Objects', detected_objects)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

**Description of functionality:**

This code implements a simple color detection algorithm in Python using OpenCV. It can be used to detect and isolate specific colors within an image. The functionality of the code is as follows:

1. It reads an image from a file.
2. Converts the image from BGR to HSV color space. HSV is a more intuitive color space for detecting specific colors because it separates hue, saturation, and value.
3. Creates a mask for the blue color using the inRange function. The mask is a binary image where the pixels corresponding to the specified color range are set to 255, and all other pixels are set to 0.
4. Similarly, creates a mask for the red color.
5. Combines the blue and red masks using bitwise OR operation to create a mask for the colors we want to detect.
6. Applies the mask to the original image using bitwise AND operation to get the detected objects.
7. Displays the detected objects in a window.
8. Waits for a key to be pressed before closing the window.
Of course! I'd be happy to help you evaluate the functionality of the code and prepare a description for a provisional patent application. Please provide the code you would like me to evaluate, and I will do my best to assist you.Improved Version:

**Detailed Description**

TriLLMOrchestrator initiates a process where a user-provided prompt is processed concurrently by multiple AI models. Each model's response is first collected and then used as input for a subsequent layer of analysis, increasing in depth and synthesis as the process advances through predefined stages (initial, meta, ultra, and hyper responses). Notably, the orchestrator incorporates a mechanism to respect the rate limits of each external AI service, using asynchronous waiting and retry strategies for robust interaction with these APIs.

A significant aspect of the orchestrator is its adaptive hardware optimization, detecting if advanced hardware acceleration (e.g., Apple Silicon's MPS) is available and enabling specific optimizations for efficient computation. This feature represents a pioneering approach to leveraging available compute resources for AI model inference tasks, making the system highly adaptable to diverse deployment environments.

The system utilizes a PromptTemplate dataclass for dynamically generating subsequent prompts based on the responses from previous stages, ensuring context relevance and continuity across the entire orchestration process. Additionally, a RateLimits dataclass is employed for configuring model-specific rate limit adherence, demonstrating an architecture that is both extensible and respectful of external API constraints.

The orchestrator can be designed to interface with different engines, each with its unique API or functionality. By integrating these engines, the invention generates a comprehensive range of responses tailored to specific user inputs.

For example, in Python, the code implementation for the orchestrator could look like this:
```
import random

class EngineSelector:
    def __init__(self, engines):
        self.engines = engines
        
    def select_engine(self, input):
        # Extract relevant information from user input
        input_representation = process_input(input)
        # Select the most appropriate engine based on the extracted information
        selected_engine = random.choice(self.engines)
        return selected_engine
        
class ResponseGenerator:
    def __init__(self, selected_engine):
        self.selected_engine = selected_engine
        
    def generate_response(self, input_representation):
        # Use the selected engine to generate a response
        response = generate_response_using_engine(self.selected_engine, input_representation)
        return response
```
In this example, the EngineSelector class is responsible for selecting the most appropriate engine based on the extracted information from the user input. The ResponseGenerator class is responsible for generating a response using the selected engine. The generate_response_using_engine function can be implemented differently depending on the specific engine being used. By integrating these classes, the present invention generates responses tailored to specific user inputs using multiple engines.
