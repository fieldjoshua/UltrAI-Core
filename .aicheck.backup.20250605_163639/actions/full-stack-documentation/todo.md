## Task Management Guidelines

- Tasks derived from the 4-phase action plan
- Each phase represents roughly 25% of total progress
- Use Claude Code's TodoWrite/TodoRead functions to manage this file
- Mark tasks as in_progress when actively working on them
- Complete tasks immediately after finishing work
- Keep documentation comprehensive but concise
