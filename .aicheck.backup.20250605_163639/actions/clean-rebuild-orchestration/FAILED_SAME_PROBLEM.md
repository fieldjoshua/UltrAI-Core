# CRITICAL: SAME PROBLEM - ORCHESTRATOR STILL BROKEN

## The Problem
After 4.5 hours of work:
- Cleaned up files ✓
- Simplified to one pattern ✓
- Deployed to production ✓
- **STILL TIMES OUT - EXACT SAME PROBLEM** ✗

## What We Did
1. Removed complexity
2. Built "minimal" orchestrator
3. Used asyncio.gather() for parallel execution
4. Deployed successfully

## Result
**THE SAME FUCKING TIMEOUT ISSUE**

## The Real Problem
The async parallel execution pattern doesn't work in the production environment. Whether it's complex patterns or simple Ultra Synthesis, the core issue remains:

**Parallel async LLM calls timeout in production**

## What Actually Needs to Happen
Stop trying to fix the parallel execution. Either:
1. Make it completely synchronous (one model at a time)
2. Use a different approach entirely (queues, workers, etc.)
3. Accept that the orchestrator doesn't work and remove it

## Time Wasted
- Previous attempts: 2-3 hours
- This attempt: 4.5 hours
- Total: ~7 hours on the same problem
