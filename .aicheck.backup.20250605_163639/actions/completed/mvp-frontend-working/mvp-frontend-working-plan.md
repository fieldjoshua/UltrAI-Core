## Purpose

Create a working MVP frontend that users can actually use to interact with the UltrAI document analysis platform. Provide a solid foundation that can be enhanced over time without dependency hell.

## Requirements

- Working user registration and login
- Document upload functionality
- AI analysis interface
- Live deployment URL for users
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- No build process or dependencies

## Dependencies

- Working backend API at https://ultrai-core.onrender.com
- GitHub account for deployment

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Build Complete Frontend (30 minutes)

- Create single-file HTML application with embedded CSS/JS
- Implement user authentication (register/login/logout)
- Add document upload functionality
- Create AI analysis interface
- Test all API connections
- Ensure responsive design

### Phase 2: Fix Backend for Real AI (20 minutes)

- Replace mock AI responses with real OpenAI/Anthropic API calls
- Update backend to use environment variables for API keys
- Deploy updated backend to Render with API keys configured
- Test real AI analysis endpoints

### Phase 3: Deploy Frontend (10 minutes)

- Deploy frontend using simple static hosting (drag-and-drop)
- Get live URL working immediately
- No config files or build process

### Phase 4: End-to-End Testing (10 minutes)

- Register new test user
- Upload sample document
- Run real AI analysis
- Verify complete user flow works with real AI
- Document live URLs

## Success Criteria

- Users can access live URL and register/login
- Users can upload documents and get AI analysis
- All API endpoints work correctly
- Complete user flow functions end-to-end
- Foundation ready for future enhancements

## Estimated Timeline

- Phase 1: 30 minutes (COMPLETED)
- Phase 2: 20 minutes
- Phase 3: 10 minutes
- Phase 4: 10 minutes
- Total: 70 minutes

## Notes

Focus on functionality over aesthetics. Build working foundation first, make it fancy later.
