# Reality Check - Critical Path Execution
Date: 2025-06-04

## What AICheck Thought
- Progress: 0%
- Status: Not Started
- All tasks pending

## Actual Reality (from Git History)
- Progress: 20% (2 of 10 tasks completed)
- Status: In Progress
- Key completions missed by tracking:
  1. Frontend API URL fixed (commit 954106ee)
  2. render.yaml created (commit 9d07051a)

## Current Blockers
1. **Middleware Error (Line 223)** - Critical blocker preventing API responses
   - Located in backend/app.py
   - error_handling_middleware function needs debugging
   - Prevents all API functionality

2. **Security Headers Disabled** - Production readiness issue
   - CSP configuration needs proper setup
   - Currently disabled as workaround

3. **Health Monitoring Broken** - Operational issue
   - Some health check endpoints not functioning
   - Needs investigation and fixes

## Next Critical Step
Debug the middleware chain issue at line 223 in backend/app.py. This is THE blocker preventing the system from being operational.

## Uncommitted Changes Note
41 files with changes, mostly documentation and UI mockups - not directly related to critical path execution. These should be reviewed and either committed or discarded to reduce context pollution.
