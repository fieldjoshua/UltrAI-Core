# Orchestration Debug Findings
Date: 2025-06-04

## Key Discovery: API Keys ARE Configured! âœ…

The `/api/health/llm` endpoint confirms:
- **OpenAI**: API key configured and working
- **Anthropic**: API key configured (health check method issue)
- **Google**: API key configured and working

## The Real Problem

The orchestration endpoint (`/api/orchestrator/feather`) times out despite having API keys. This points to a code issue, not a configuration issue.

### Evidence:
1. Health check shows `api_key_configured: true` for all providers
2. OpenAI and Google show "API connection successful"
3. Orchestration requests timeout after 30+ seconds
4. No error response, just hanging connection

### Likely Causes:
1. **Async/await issue** - The error from earlier testing mentioned "object str can't be used in 'await' expression"
2. **Missing error handling** - Request hangs instead of returning error
3. **Infinite loop or deadlock** in orchestration logic
4. **CSRF protection** might be interfering (saw CSRF error on test endpoint)

## Next Steps Needed:

1. **Check orchestration code** for async/await issues
2. **Add timeout handling** to prevent hanging
3. **Enable debug logging** to see where it's failing
4. **Test with mock mode** properly implemented

## Conclusion:

The infrastructure and API keys are working! The issue is in the orchestration code implementation, not the configuration. This is actually good news - it means the system is closer to working than we thought.
