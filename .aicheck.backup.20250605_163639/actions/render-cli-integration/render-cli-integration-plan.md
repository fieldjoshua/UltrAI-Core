# ACTION: render-cli-integration

Version: 1.0
Last Updated: 2025-05-28
Status: Planning
Progress: 0%

## Purpose

Integrate Render CLI into the UltraAI deployment workflow to provide better deployment control, eliminate deployment verification oversights, and streamline the development-to-production pipeline. This action directly addresses the recent issue where sophisticated orchestrator code existed locally but antiquated code was running in production.

## Requirements

- Render CLI installation and authentication
- Automated deployment scripts with verification
- Production endpoint testing automation
- Documentation updates for team workflows
- Integration with existing AICheck processes

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Render CLI (npm package or binary)
- jq for JSON processing
- curl for endpoint testing
- Access to Render account and service

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing deployment configuration
- Production service at https://ultrai-core-4lut.onrender.com
- Current scripts/ directory structure
- CLAUDE.md documentation system

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: CLI Setup and Configuration

- Install Render CLI via npm or direct download
- Authenticate with Render account
- Identify service IDs for ultrai-core service
- Test basic CLI operations (deploy, status, logs)
- Verify permissions and access levels

### Phase 2: Automation Scripts Development

- Create core deployment script (`scripts/deploy-render.sh`)
- Build production verification script (`scripts/verify-production.sh`)
- Develop environment management script (`scripts/render-env.sh`)
- Add build cache clearing automation
- Include deployment status monitoring

### Phase 3: Documentation and Integration

- Update CLAUDE.md with CLI commands and workflows
- Create comprehensive deployment guide
- Document troubleshooting procedures
- Integrate with AICheck action templates
- Add deployment verification requirements to rules

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation

- End-to-end deployment testing via CLI
- Verification script validation
- Error handling and edge case testing
- Performance impact assessment
- Team workflow validation

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Render CLI installed, configured, and authenticated
- ✅ Automated deployment script with verification working
- ✅ Production verification script detecting code mismatches
- ✅ Documentation updated and comprehensive
- ✅ Single-command deployment workflow operational
- ✅ Deployment verification gaps eliminated
- ✅ Team can use CLI for all deployment operations

## Estimated Timeline

- CLI Setup: 1 day
- Script Development: 2 days
- Documentation: 1 day
- Testing & Validation: 1 day
- Total: 5 days

## Notes

This action is critical for preventing the deployment verification oversight that occurred with the orchestration integration. The CLI provides programmatic access to deployment operations and enables automated verification that the correct code is actually running in production, not just committed to the repository.
