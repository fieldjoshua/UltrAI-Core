# Next Move Recommendation

Date: 2025-05-27
Author: Claude Code

## Current Status

✅ **orchestration-integration-fix** has been COMPLETED:
- All code implementation finished (verified 2025-05-25)
- All documentation updated per RULES
- ACTION_TIMELINE.md already shows completion
- All success criteria met

## Recommended Next Action: production-orchestration-verification

### Rationale

The sophisticated 4-stage Feather orchestration system is fully implemented in code but needs production verification. This aligns with RULES Section 6.1.1 - Deployment Verification Requirements.

### Proposed Action Plan

**Action Name**: `production-orchestration-verification`

**Purpose**: Verify the sophisticated orchestration features work correctly in production environment

**Success Criteria**:
1. ✅ All orchestration endpoints return correct data in production
2. ✅ Frontend can successfully call orchestration APIs
3. ✅ 4-stage Feather process completes with real API keys
4. ✅ All 10 analysis patterns are accessible
5. ✅ Performance meets acceptable thresholds

**Key Tasks**:
1. Test production endpoints at https://ultrai-core.onrender.com/
2. Verify API keys are configured in production
3. Test each analysis pattern with real prompts
4. Monitor performance and error rates
5. Document any issues for resolution

### Alternative: security-vulnerability-fix

If production verification can wait, addressing the 33 security vulnerabilities (4 critical) would be a high-value action that protects the system before wider deployment.

## Immediate Steps

1. Create new action directory: `.aicheck/actions/production-orchestration-verification/`
2. Create action plan with detailed testing criteria
3. Set as ActiveAction
4. Begin systematic production testing

## Important Note

Per RULES Section 6.1.1, we MUST verify deployment before marking orchestration features as fully complete. While the code is done, production verification is required to ensure users can actually access these sophisticated features.
