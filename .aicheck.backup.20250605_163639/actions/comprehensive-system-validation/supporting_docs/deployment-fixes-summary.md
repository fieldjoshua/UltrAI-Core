# Deployment Fixes Summary

## Date: 2025-05-26

## Issues Identified

1. **Orchestrator Routes Not Accessible**: The `/api/orchestrator/*` endpoints were returning 404 errors
2. **Import Failure**: The PatternOrchestrator import from `src/core` was failing in production
3. **Missing Requirements**: No requirements.txt file in root directory for Render deployment

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Improved Import Handling in orchestrator_routes.py
- Added multi-stage import fallback logic
- Better error handling and logging
- Path resolution that works in both development and production
- Proper fallback implementation when imports fail

### 2. Created requirements.txt
- Added comprehensive production dependencies
- Included all LLM provider SDKs
- Added necessary middleware and security packages

### 3. Fixed Pattern Mapping
- Updated get_pattern_mapping to handle both dict and object formats
- Ensures patterns endpoint works even with fallback implementation

## Files Modified

1. `/backend/routes/orchestrator_routes.py` - Improved import logic
2. `/requirements.txt` - Created comprehensive requirements file

## Files Created for Documentation

1. `supporting_docs/fix-orchestrator-import.py` - Script to demonstrate fixes
2. `supporting_docs/pattern_orchestrator_integration.py` - Integration module
3. `supporting_docs/orchestrator_routes_fixed.py` - Fixed version of routes
4. `supporting_docs/requirements-orchestrator.txt` - Orchestrator-specific deps
5. `supporting_docs/deployment-fixes-summary.md` - This summary

## Next Steps

1. Commit these changes to git
2. Push to GitHub (need auth fix)
3. Trigger Render redeploy
4. Re-run validation tests
5. Continue with remaining Phase 1 tests

## Testing Command

After deployment, run:
```bash
python3 .aicheck/actions/comprehensive-system-validation/supporting_docs/test-deployed-service.py
