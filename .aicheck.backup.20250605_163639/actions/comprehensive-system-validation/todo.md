## Completed Tasks

*No tasks completed yet*

## Notes

- Action plan reference: `comprehensive-system-validation-plan.md`
- Dependencies: Production deployment must be accessible
- Progress tracking: Update after each phase completion
- Special considerations: Focus on patent-protected feature validation
- Critical validation: Ensure all sophisticated features are user-accessible

## Task Management Guidelines

- This action validates the entire UltraAI system post-orchestration integration
- Each phase builds on previous phase results
- Document all test results in supporting_docs/test-reports/
- Create automated test scripts where possible for regression testing
- Report any blocking issues immediately for remediation
