# ACTION: MCPSetup

Version: 1.0
Last Updated: 2025-05-22
Status: Completed
Progress: 100%

## Purpose

Configure Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to enable Claude Code to connect to external tools and services, enhancing the development workflow with additional capabilities like file system access, database connections, and API integrations.

## Requirements

- Configure MCP server connections for Claude Code
- Enable file system access through MCP
- Set up database connectivity if needed
- Configure API integration capabilities
- Ensure secure credential management
- Test MCP server connectivity

## Dependencies

- Claude Code CLI installed and working
- Node.js/npm for MCP server dependencies
- Python environment for Python-based MCP servers

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Research

- Investigate available MCP servers and their capabilities
- Review Claude Code MCP documentation
- Identify which MCP servers would be most beneficial for this project
- Research configuration file formats and locations

### Phase 2: Design

- Design MCP server configuration architecture
- Plan credential management strategy
- Design testing approach for MCP connectivity
- Create configuration templates

### Phase 3: Implementation

- Install required MCP server packages
- Create MCP configuration file (.claude_mcp_config.json)
- Configure file system MCP server
- Configure database MCP server if needed
- Set up API integration MCP servers
- Implement secure credential storage

### Phase 4: Testing

- Test basic MCP server connectivity
- Verify file system access through MCP
- Test database operations if configured
- Validate API integration functionality
- Test credential security and rotation

## Success Criteria

- MCP servers are properly configured and accessible
- Claude Code can successfully connect to and use MCP servers
- File system operations work through MCP
- All credentials are securely managed
- Configuration is documented and maintainable
- MCP functionality enhances development workflow

## Estimated Timeline

- Research: 0.5 days
- Design: 0.5 days
- Implementation: 1 day
- Testing: 0.5 days
- Total: 2.5 days

## Notes

MCP (Model Context Protocol) allows Claude Code to connect to external tools and services, significantly expanding its capabilities beyond the built-in tools. This setup will enable better integration with the development environment and project-specific tools.
