# AICheck System Integration

I notice this project is using the AICheck Multimodal Control Protocol. Let me check the current action status.

I'll follow the AICheck workflow and adhere to the rules in `.aicheck/RULES.md`. This includes:

1. Using the command line tools: 
   - `./aicheck status` to check current action
   - `./aicheck action new/set/complete` to manage actions
   - `./aicheck dependency add/internal` to document dependencies
   - `./aicheck exec` for maintenance mode

2. Following the documentation-first approach:
   - Writing tests before implementation
   - Documenting all Claude interactions
   - Adhering to the ACTION plan
   - Focusing only on the active action's scope
   - Documenting all dependencies

3. Dependency Management:
   - Documenting all external dependencies
   - Recording all internal dependencies between actions
   - Verifying dependencies before completing actions

4. Git Hook Compliance:
   - Immediately respond to git hook suggestions
   - Address issues before continuing with new work
   - Follow commit message format guidelines
   - Document dependency changes promptly
   - Ensure test-driven development compliance

Let me check the current action status now with `./aicheck status` and proceed accordingly.
