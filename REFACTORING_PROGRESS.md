## Completed Tasks

- Backend directory structure created
- Models extracted from main.py
- Utility functions extracted into dedicated modules
- Service modules created for document processing and mock LLM
- Health and metrics routes extracted
- Document routes extracted
- Analysis routes extracted
- Pricing routes extracted
- User management routes extracted
- Authentication service implemented
- Pricing services organized
- Test suite updated for new structure
- Documentation updated to reflect new architecture
- Created new app.py entry point with router integration

## Phase 3 Plans (Future Work)

1. Migrate from file-based storage to database (MongoDB or PostgreSQL)
2. Implement proper error handling and logging across all modules
3. Add request validation middleware
4. Enhance authentication with OAuth integration
5. Add rate limiting for API endpoints
6. Implement caching strategy for high-demand endpoints
7. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

## Lessons Learned

- Organizing routes by domain improves code readability
- Separating models from route handlers makes the code more maintainable
- Using FastAPI's router system simplifies the main application file
- JWT-based authentication provides a clean, stateless authentication solution
- Modular service architecture makes testing and extending functionality easier
- Dedicated documentation improves onboarding for new developers
