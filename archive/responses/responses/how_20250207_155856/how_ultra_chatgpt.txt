**Comprehensive Synthesis on Building a Multimodal AI Model Orchestrator**

In the quest to create a robust multimodal AI model orchestrator, a harmonious blend of detailed technical insights, strategic development phases, and proactively addressing potential challenges is vital. An orchestrator capable of effectively combining generative AI models to generate cohesive and context-aware outputs from diverse inputs necessitates a thoughtful, systematic approach underscored by innovative solutions and ethical considerations.

**Development Blueprint**

- **Objective**: To architect a system that skillfully leverages an array of generative AI models specializing in different domains (text, images, audio, etc.) to produce integrated and contextually relevant outputs in response to varied user prompts.
  
- **Modular System Design**: Emphasizing a modular architecture enhances integration flexibility, enabling seamless scalability and efficient model management. This foundation supports the orchestration logic, facilitating dynamic model selection and interoperability.

- **Model Selection and Integration**: A stringent process for model curation is critical, focusing on domain-specific performance and potential for seamless collaboration across models. This involves utilizing standardized APIs and microservices for effective communication and data exchange.

- **Prompt Processing and Model Coordination**: The system must adeptly analyze user inputs, routing them to appropriate models while ensuring models selected are best suited for the task at hand. Sophisticated model coordination mechanisms leverage distributed computing or federated learning to synchronize contributions towards a collective output.

- **Output Aggregation and User Interface**: Employing advanced algorithms to synthesize model outputs into a singular, coherent response is as crucial as providing a user-friendly interface for inputting prompts and receiving responses.

**Addressing Challenges**

1. **Complex Integration and Compatibility**: Adopting flexible, extensible design principles with unified data formats simplifies model integration. Regular interoperability evaluations and bias correction frameworks ensure model compatibility and fairness.

2. **Performance Optimization**: Strategies for efficient data handling and model invocation, alongside continuous training and updates based on performance metrics, optimize system performance and maintain model relevance.

3. **Ethical and Security Considerations**: Strong security protocols, privacy protection measures, and adherence to ethical guidelines fortify the orchestrator's integrity. Continuous assessment and updates ensure alignment with ethical standards and user expectations.

4. **Scalability and Continuous Improvement**: A scalable platform must be equipped to efficiently manage growing demands. Incorporating feedback mechanisms fosters adaptability and ongoing enhancement, addressing challenges like computational resource demands, explainability, and user feedback management.

**Conclusion**

The conception and realization of a multimodal AI model orchestrator present a complex but achievable challenge, promising to revolutionize content creation and task resolution through AI. By meticulously planning its development, rigorously addressing integration and operational challenges, and adhering to ethical practices, this orchestrator stands to significantly elevate the utility and applicability of generative AI technologies across varied domains, ensuring not only seamless intermodal collaboration but also alignment with user needs and societal standards.
