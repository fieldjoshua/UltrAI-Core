Technical Field:
The present invention relates to a novel method for generating responses to user inputs using multiple artificial intelligence (AI) models. More specifically, the invention pertains to an orchestrator that can leverage various AI engines to create the ultra/hyper responses.

Background:
Conversational AI has gained significant attention in recent years due to advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) technologies. Chatbots, virtual assistants, and other conversational interfaces have become increasingly popular across various industries, including customer service, e-commerce, healthcare, and finance. However, the performance of these conversational AI systems can be limited by their reliance on a single AI model or engine. To overcome this limitation, researchers have proposed the concept of "ultra" or "hyper" responses, which involve combining the outputs of multiple AI models to create more informative and contextually relevant responses.

Summary of the Invention:
The present invention provides an orchestrator that can coordinate multiple AI engines (e.g., Llama, ChatGPT, Gemini) to generate ultra/hyper responses to user inputs. The orchestrator leverages the strengths of each engine to create more comprehensive and accurate responses, while also mitigating their individual weaknesses. By combining the outputs of multiple engines, the present invention enables conversational AI systems to provide more informative and contextually relevant responses, ultimately leading to improved user experiences.

Detailed Description:
The orchestrator of the present invention consists of several components, including:

1. Engine Selection: The orchestrator can select the most appropriate engine for a given task based on factors such as the complexity of the input, the desired level of accuracy, and the available computational resources.
2. Input Preprocessing: The orchestrator can preprocess user inputs to enhance their quality and facilitate the response generation process. This may involve tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and other natural language processing techniques.
3. Engine Execution: The orchestrator executes each selected engine to generate responses based on the input. The outputs of these engines are then combined to create the ultra/hyper response.
4. Response Generation: The orchestrator can generate responses by combining the outputs of multiple engines using various methods, such as concatenating, weighting, or fusing the outputs. These methods allow the orchestrator to adaptively balance the contributions of each engine based on their individual strengths and weaknesses.
5. Post-processing: The orchestrator can apply post-processing techniques to further refine the generated responses. This may involve tasks such as language modeling, sentiment analysis, or machine translation.

a. An engine selection component to choose the most appropriate engine for a given task;

2. The system of claim 1, wherein the engine selection component considers factors such as the complexity of the input, the desired level of accuracy, and the available computational resources.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the input preprocessing component involves tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, or other natural language processing techniques.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the engine execution component involves executing multiple AI models to generate responses based on the input.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the response generation component combines the outputs of multiple engines using methods such as concatenating, weighting, or fusing the outputs.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the post-processing component involves tasks such as language modeling, sentiment analysis, or machine translation to further refine the generated responses.

Code Implementation:
The orchestrator of the present invention can be implemented using various programming languages and frameworks, such as Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, or Rust. The following code snippets illustrate a basic implementation of the engine selection, input preprocessing, and response generation components:
```python
# Engine selection component
def select_engine(input):
    # Determine the most appropriate engine for the given task
    if input. complexity > 5:
        return "llama"
    elif input.desired_accuracy > 0.8:
        return "chatgpt"
    else:
        return "gemini"

# Input preprocessing component
def preprocess_input(input):
    # Tokenize the input and perform named entity recognition
    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(input)
    entities = named_entities.recognize(tokens)
    return entities

# Response generation component
def generate_response(input, engines):
    # Concatenate the outputs of multiple engines
    responses = []
    for engine in engines:
        response = engine.generate(input)
        responses.append(response)
    return "".join(responses)
```
These code snippets demonstrate a basic implementation of the orchestrator components, but the actual implementation may vary depending on the specific use case and requirements. The present invention can be further refined and optimized through additional development and fine-tuning of these components.
