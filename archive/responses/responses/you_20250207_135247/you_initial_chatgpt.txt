---

## 1. Field of the Invention

The present invention relates to artificial intelligence systems, and more particularly to a method and system for orchestrating multiple AI models to collaboratively analyze and synthesize data.

## 2. Background of the Invention

In the realm of data analysis, it's often challenging to process and interpret large volumes of data through a single artificial intelligence (AI) model due to the complexity and diverse nature of the data. Different models excel in various tasks but may not perform well outside their specialties. There is a need for a system that utilizes the strengths of multiple AI models, enabling them to work in concert to analyze and synthesize information more efficiently and accurately.

## 3. Summary of the Invention

The present invention seeks to address the aforementioned challenges by providing a system and method for orchestrating multiple AI models to collaboratively analyze and synthesize information from diverse data sources. This system leverages the unique strengths of each participating AI model, coordinating them to perform tasks beyond their individual capabilities.

*Fig. 3* shows an example of a decision-making process undertaken by the system to select and sequence AI models for a given task.

## 5. Detailed Description of the Invention

The system comprises several key components, each playing a crucial role in the collaborative analysis and synthesis of information:

### 5.1 Orchestrator

The orchestrator serves as the central control unit, responsible for managing the interactions among various AI models. It determines the sequence in which models are activated, based on the task requirements and the strengths of each model. The orchestrator utilizes machine learning techniques to optimize the order of operations and data flow to achieve the best overall performance.

### 5.2 AI Models

Multiple AI models, each with its own specialized area of expertise, are integrated into the system. These may include, but are not limited to, natural language processing models, image recognition models, and predictive analytics models. The system is designed to be modular, allowing for the addition, removal, or replacement of AI models as needed.

### 5.3 Data Preprocessor

The data preprocessor prepares incoming data for analysis, performing tasks such as format conversion, noise reduction, and normalization. This step ensures that the data is in a suitable state for processing by the AI models.

### 5.4 Data Postprocessor

Once the AI models have analyzed the data, the postprocessor combines and refines their outputs. This may involve resolving conflicts between models, synthesizing insights, and preparing the final output in a user-friendly format.

### 5.5 User Interface

The user interface allows humans to interact with the system, specifying tasks, providing inputs, and receiving outputs. It includes mechanisms for users to provide feedback, which is used by the system to improve performance over time.

## 6. Operation of the Invention

The operation of the system can be summarized in the following steps:

1. **Initialization:** The user specifies a task through the user interface.
2. **Preprocessing:** Incoming data is prepared by the data preprocessor.
3. **Orchestration:** The orchestrator selects and sequences the AI models best suited for the task.
4. **Analysis and Synthesis:** The selected AI models collaboratively analyze the data, with their outputs being combined and refined by the data postprocessor.
5. **Presentation:** The final output is presented to the user through the user interface.

## 7. Advantages of the Invention

- **Enhanced Accuracy:** By leveraging multiple AI models, the system can achieve higher accuracy than any single model could on its own.
- **Versatility:** The modular design allows the system to tackle a wide range of tasks, from simple data analysis to complex problem-solving.
- **Scalability:** Additional AI models can be easily integrated into the system to expand its capabilities.
- **Efficiency:** The orchestrator optimizes the sequence of model activation, reducing processing time and resources.
