# Ultra Monitoring

This directory contains the monitoring and performance analysis tools for the Ultra AI Framework.

## Files

- `ultra_performance.py`: Performance measurement and analysis utilities
- `ultra_monitoring.py`: Monitoring infrastructure and metrics collection
- `performance_test.py`: Benchmarking tools and performance test suite

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track system performance metrics in real-time
- **Token Usage Tracking**: Monitor token consumption across different models
- **Response Time Analysis**: Measure and analyze response times for different operation types
- **Benchmarking**: Tools for measuring system performance under various loads
- **Performance Dashboard**: Data collection for the performance visualization dashboard

## Integration

The monitoring system integrates with the main Ultra framework through hooks in the pattern orchestrator and API clients. It captures metrics at various stages of processing.

## Usage

### Basic Monitoring

```python
from monitoring.ultra_monitoring import UltraMonitor

# Initialize the monitor
monitor = UltraMonitor()

# Start timing an operation
monitor.start_operation("analysis")

# Perform the operation
# ...

# End timing and record metrics
monitor.end_operation("analysis",
                      tokens_used=250,
                      success=True,
                      model="gpt-4")
```

### Running Performance Tests

```bash
python -m monitoring.performance_test --iterations 100 --concurrency 5
```

## Dashboard

The monitoring data is visualized in the Performance Dashboard, which can be accessed through the frontend application.
