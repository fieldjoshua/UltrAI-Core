Before you help me, please review the project's rules:

1. Check .aicheck/RULES.md for project-specific guidelines
2. Follow a documentation-first approach by ensuring you are working on the ActiveAction, following the PLAN within the ActiveAction and creating appropriate new Actions when appropriate
3. DRY: Don't repeat yourself do not create multiple superfluous documents.
4. Adhere to language-specific best practices
5. Use the appropriate error handling patterns
6. Follow Python (PEP 8) and TypeScript/React (ESLint + Prettier) code style guidelines
7. Document all functions with docstrings or JSDoc as appropriate

Please ensure your suggestions and implementations comply with these guidelines.
