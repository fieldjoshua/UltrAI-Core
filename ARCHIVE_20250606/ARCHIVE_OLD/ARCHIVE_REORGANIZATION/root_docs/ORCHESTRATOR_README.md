## 🚀 **4-Stage Feather Analysis Flow**

The UltraAI system orchestrates multiple LLMs through a sophisticated 4-stage pipeline:

### **Stage 1: INITIAL ANALYSIS** 
```
📥 INPUT: Original user prompt
🔄 PROCESS: All selected LLMs respond independently in parallel
📤 OUTPUT: Dictionary of initial responses from each model
⭐ QUALITY: Each response scored on 4 dimensions
```

**What happens:**
- User prompt sent to all selected LLMs simultaneously
- Each model (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, etc.) generates independent response
- Parallel execution for optimal performance
- Quality evaluation: coherence, technical depth, strategic value, uniqueness

**Example Models Used:** `["openai-gpt4o", "anthropic-claude", "google-gemini", "deepseek-chat"]`

---

### **Stage 2: META ANALYSIS**
```
📥 INPUT: Own initial response + All other LLM responses + Original prompt
🔄 PROCESS: Each LLM refines its response considering others' perspectives
📤 OUTPUT: Meta-level refined responses maintaining unique perspectives
⭐ QUALITY: Cross-model perspective integration
```

**What happens:**
- Each LLM receives its own initial response
- Plus all other LLMs' initial responses
- Plus specific meta-analysis prompt template
- Each model refines while maintaining its unique analytical approach
- **Key:** Does not assume factual correctness of other responses

**Meta Prompt Template (Gut Pattern):**
```
Original prompt: {original_prompt}

Your initial response:
{own_response}

Other LLM responses:
{other_responses}

Please provide an edited version of your original response that:
1. Maintains your core insights
2. Incorporates any valuable perspectives from other responses
3. Addresses any potential gaps or limitations
4. Does not assume factual correctness of other responses
5. Preserves your unique analytical approach
```

---

### **Stage 3: HYPER ANALYSIS**
```
📥 INPUT: All meta responses + Original prompt
🔄 PROCESS: Selected "Hyper Model" synthesizes meta responses
📤 OUTPUT: Single hyper-level synthesis response
⭐ QUALITY: Advanced synthesis with model attribution
```

**What happens:**
- System selects the best available model for synthesis
- **Model Priority:** Claude → GPT-4 → Mistral → Gemini
- Hyper model receives all meta responses in structured format
- Creates sophisticated synthesis maintaining distinct perspectives
- Highlights unique insights and compelling arguments

**Hyper Model Selection Logic:**
```python
hyper_model = "claude" if "claude" in available_models else "chatgpt"
```

**Hyper Prompt Template:**
```
Original prompt: {original_prompt}

All meta-level responses:
{meta_responses}

Please provide a refined synthesis that:
1. Strengthens key arguments
2. Addresses valid points from other responses
3. Maintains analytical perspectives
4. Highlights unique insights
5. Preserves original reasoning
```

---

### **Stage 4: ULTRA ANALYSIS**
```
📥 INPUT: Hyper synthesis + Original prompt
🔄 PROCESS: Selected "Ultra Model" creates definitive orchestrated response
📤 OUTPUT: Final ultra-level synthesis - the definitive answer
⭐ QUALITY: Highest quality orchestrated output with full attribution
```

**What happens:**
- System selects the best available model for final synthesis
- **Model Priority:** Claude → GPT-4 → Mistral → Gemini
- Ultra model creates the definitive orchestrated response
- Preserves sophistication while providing clear final answer
- Full attribution to contributing models and insights

**Ultra Model Selection Logic:**
```python
ultra_models = ["claude", "chatgpt", "mistral", "gemini"]
ultra_model = next((m for m in ultra_models if m in available_models), "chatgpt")
```

**Ultra Prompt Template:**
```
Original prompt: {original_prompt}

Hyper-level synthesis:
{hyper_responses}

Please create a final synthesis that:
1. Preserves unique analytical approaches
2. Highlights the most compelling insights
3. Maintains distinct perspectives
4. Emphasizes original reasoning
5. Presents a balanced view of different approaches
```
