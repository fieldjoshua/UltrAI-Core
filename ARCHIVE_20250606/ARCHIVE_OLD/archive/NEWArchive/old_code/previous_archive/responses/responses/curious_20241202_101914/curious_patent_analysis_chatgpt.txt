**Technical Field**

The invention pertains to the field of artificial intelligence, more specifically to a system for orchestrating responses and analyses from multiple artificial intelligence models in a hierarchical manner to synthesize insights and information processing.

**Background**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have become ubiquitous in solving complex tasks, ranging from natural language processing to image recognition. However, individual AI models often have limitations in terms of understanding context, generating creative content, and synthesizing information from multiple sources. There is a need for an advanced orchestration system that can leverage the strengths of multiple AI models to produce enhanced, synthesized outputs that surpass the capabilities of any single AI model.

**Summary of the Invention**

The invention introduces the "TriLLMOrchestrator", an advanced system designed to orchestrate the interaction of multiple AI models in a unique, hierarchical manner to produce synthesized, insightful outputs. The system utilizes a combination of local and cloud-based AI models, including but not limited to models from Google and OpenAI, integrating them in a multi-stage processing pipeline that refines and enhances the outputs at each stage.

**Detailed Description**

The TriLLMOrchestrator employs a series of stages—initial, meta, ultra, and hyper—to process and enhance the input prompts through various AI models. Each stage involves collecting responses from multiple models, analyzing these responses, and creating new, enriched prompts that accumulate insights from previous stages. This hierarchical processing leads to a final synthesis that encapsulates unique insights, patterns, and valuable elements identified through the systematic engagement of different AI capabilities.

Key components and methodologies include:

1. **Prompt Templates** for structuring interactions with AI models at each stage of processing.
2. **Rate Limits** tailored to each AI model, ensuring efficient utilization of resources without exceeding API quotas.
3. **Hardware Configuration and Performance Monitoring** to optimize processing based on available computational resources.
4. **AI Model Initialization and Interaction** including innovative use of retry and exponential backoff strategies to handle API request limitations and errors seamlessly.
5. **Data Classes** to structure configuration details, rate limits, and prompt templates neatly, enhancing code readability and maintenance.
6. **Asyncio for Concurrency**: Utilizes Python's asyncio for asynchronous programming, allowing simultaneous API calls and background tasks like performance monitoring and patent analysis, greatly improving the system's efficiency.
