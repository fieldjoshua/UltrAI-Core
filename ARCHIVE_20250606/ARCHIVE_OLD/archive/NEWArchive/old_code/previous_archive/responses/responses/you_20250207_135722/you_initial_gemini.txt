**Provisional Patent Application**

**Title:** System for Orchestrating Multiple AI Models for Collaborative Analysis and Synthesis

**Inventors:** [Inventor Names]

**Application Type:** Provisional

**Abstract:**

This invention relates to a system for orchestrating multiple AI models to collaboratively analyze and synthesize information. The system enables effective collaboration among diverse AI models, leading to enhanced accuracy, efficiency, and comprehensive insights.

**Background:**

AI models are increasingly used for various tasks, from image recognition to natural language processing. However, individual AI models often have their strengths and limitations. Orchestrating multiple models to work together can significantly improve performance and broaden the scope of applications.

**Technical Description:**

The proposed system orchestrates multiple AI models through the following components:

* **Model Repository:** Stores and manages a collection of AI models.
* **Orchestrator:** Central component that assigns tasks and coordinates the collaboration of individual models.
* **Model Interface:** Provides a standardized interface for models to communicate and exchange data.
* **Data Fusion Module:** Aggregates and processes data from multiple models to extract valuable insights.
* **Synthesis Engine:** Generates comprehensive outputs by combining insights from the individual models.

**Method of Operation:**

1. The orchestrator selects an appropriate set of models for a given task.
2. The selected models execute their analysis independently and generate initial results.
3. The data fusion module consolidates the results and identifies potential conflicts or inconsistencies.
4. The synthesis engine combines the results, leveraging consensus and resolving conflicts to produce a final output.
5. The final output is presented to the user or integrated into downstream applications.

**Advantages:**

* **Enhanced Accuracy:** Collaboration among diverse models reduces bias and improves accuracy.
* **Increased Efficiency:** Orchestration optimizes model selection and task distribution, reducing processing time.
* **Comprehensive Insights:** By combining insights from multiple models, the system generates more comprehensive and valuable results.
* **Broadened Applications:** The system enables AI models to be applied to complex tasks that require multiple perspectives.

**Industrial Applications:**

* Fraud detection and prevention
* Risk assessment and prediction
* Healthcare diagnosis and treatment planning
* Financial analysis and forecasting
* Customer segmentation and targeting
