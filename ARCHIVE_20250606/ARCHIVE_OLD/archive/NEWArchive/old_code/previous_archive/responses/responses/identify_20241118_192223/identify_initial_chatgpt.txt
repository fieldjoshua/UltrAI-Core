As of my last update in 2023, I can't directly fetch or list the latest articles due to my static nature. However, I can provide a guideline on how to identify and what to look for in top future-looking articles about life with Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). When seeking insightful articles about AGI, it's essential to look for pieces that tackle various aspects such as societal impacts, ethical considerations, technological advancements, and speculative possibilities. Here are types of articles or themes you should seek out for a comprehensive understanding of future life with AGI:

1. **Ethical Implications of AGI** - Articles exploring the ethical concerns, including privacy issues, decision-making autonomy, and moral responsibility of AGIs.

2. **Economic Impacts of AGI** - Discussions on how AGI could transform job markets, wealth distribution, and economic structures globally.

3. **Future of Work with AGI** - Articles speculating on how AGI might coexist with humans in workplaces, automate jobs, or create new employment opportunities.

4. **AGI and Governance** - Analysis on how AGI could be regulated, the role of international entities, and the implications for democracy and surveillance.

5. **Human-AGI Interaction** - Insightful predictions on the daily interaction between humans and AGIs, including potential social and psychological impacts.

6. **AGI in Healthcare** - Speculations on AGI applications in diagnostics, treatment planning, and healthcare administration, including ethical dilemmas.

7. **Education and AGI** - Projections about how AGI could revolutionize learning methods, personalization in education, and educational accessibility.

8. **AGI and Creativity** - Exploration of AGI's potential role in art, music, literature, and whether AGI can truly be creative or enhance human creativity.

9. **AGI in Smart Cities and Infrastructure** - Predictions on how AGI could manage and optimize energy consumption, traffic, public services, and environmental sustainability.

10. **Long-term Implications of AGI** - Philosophical and far-reaching predictions about AGI's impact on human evolution, existential risks, and the possibility of a post-scarcity society.

Identifying the "top" articles within this scope would depend on several factors including the source's credibility, the author's expertise, and the depth of insight provided. Leading technology journals, academic publications, reputable news outlets, and recognized industry bloggers are good starting points. Websites like Medium, Wired, Futurism, The Verge, and academic journals or conference proceedings like those from the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) often feature forward-looking articles on AGI and its implications.

Given the evolving nature of AGI research and public discourse, staying up-to-date will require regular review of recent publications and discussions. Searching for articles within the last year or attending conferences focused on AI, technology, and ethics can also provide fresh, authoritative insights on what the future with AGI may look like.
