Enhancing circulation and energy levels through dietary supplements can indeed complement a healthy diet and exercise regimen. However, it is crucial to consult your healthcare provider before starting any new supplement, especially if you have pre-existing conditions or are taking other medications. That said, here are some over-the-counter supplements you might consider to potentially boost circulation and energy levels:

1. **Omega-3 Fatty Acids**: Found in fish oil supplements, omega-3 fatty acids have been suggested to support heart health and improve blood flow. They may also have a positive effect on mood and cognition.

2. **Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)**: This is an antioxidant that your body produces naturally, but levels decrease with age. CoQ10 plays a critical role in energy production within cells and may improve blood flow and endothelial function.

3. **Magnesium**: An essential mineral for over 300 enzymatic reactions in the body, magnesium can help with muscle and nerve function, blood sugar control, and blood pressure regulation. It's often recommended for better sleep quality, which can indirectly affect energy levels.

4. **L-Arginine**: This amino acid is converted in the body into a chemical called nitric oxide, which helps blood vessels open wider for improved blood flow. L-arginine may help with circulation and is often marketed for heart health and exercise performance.

5. **Beetroot Powder**: Rich in nitrates, beetroot is known for its ability to enhance nitric oxide production in the body, potentially improving blood flow and lowering blood pressure. It's popular among athletes for its supposed benefits in improving physical performance.

6. **Iron**: If you have been diagnosed with or are at risk of iron deficiency anemia, iron supplements can increase your energy levels by improving the capacity of your blood to carry oxygen. Only take iron supplements if recommended by your healthcare provider, as excessive iron intake can be harmful.

7. **Vitamin B12**: Especially important for those who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet, vitamin B12 is crucial for producing red blood cells and may help improve energy levels in those who are deficient.

8. **Ginseng**: Often used in traditional Chinese medicine, ginseng has been touted for its potential to boost energy levels, reduce fatigue, and improve physical performance. However, results are mixed, and more research is needed to confirm these benefits.

Remember, supplements can interact with medications or other supplements and may not be suitable for everyone. Additionally, focusing on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats, staying hydrated, maintaining a regular exercise routine, and ensuring adequate sleep are all pivotal for optimal health, circulation, and energy levels. Always consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen to determine if it's appropriate for your health needs and goals.
