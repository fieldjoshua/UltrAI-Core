**Technical Field**
The present invention relates generally to artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and more particularly to systems that orchestrate multiple AI models to provide a comprehensive and enhanced response to a user's prompt.

**Background**
AI models have become increasingly powerful and capable, and are now being used in a wide variety of applications, from natural language processing and computer vision to machine translation and decision-making. However, individual AI models often have limitations, such as bias, lack of context, and inability to handle complex tasks.

To overcome these limitations, researchers have developed systems that orchestrate multiple AI models to work together. These systems can combine the strengths of different models to provide a more comprehensive and accurate response. However, existing orchestration systems suffer from a number of drawbacks.

**Summary of the Invention**
The present invention provides a novel and improved system for orchestrating multiple AI models. The system includes a plurality of AI models, each of which is specialized in a particular domain or task. The system also includes a controller that is responsible for coordinating the interactions between the models.

The controller uses a variety of techniques to orchestrate the models, including:

* **Model selection:** The controller selects the most appropriate models for each task based on their expertise and availability.
* **Prompt generation:** The controller generates prompts for each model that are designed to elicit specific information or insights from the model.
* **Response aggregation:** The controller aggregates the responses from the models to produce a comprehensive and coherent response to the user's prompt.

The system also includes a number of features that improve the efficiency and accuracy of the orchestration process. These features include:

* **Rate limiting:** The controller implements rate limiting to prevent the models from being overloaded with requests.
* **Error handling:** The controller handles errors that occur during the orchestration process, and provides feedback to the user if necessary.
* **Logging:** The controller logs all of the interactions between the models and the controller, which can be used for debugging and analysis purposes.

**Detailed Description**
The following is a detailed description of the system, including the components, operation, and features of the system.

**Components**
The system includes the following components:

* **AI models:** The system includes a plurality of AI models, each of which is specialized in a particular domain or task. The models can be any type of AI model, such as a natural language processing model, a computer vision model, or a machine translation model.
* **Controller:** The controller is responsible for coordinating the interactions between the models. The controller includes a number of modules, including a model selection module, a prompt generation module, and a response aggregation module.
* **Database:** The database stores information about the models, the prompts, and the responses. The database can be used for debugging and analysis purposes.

**Operation**
The system operates as follows:

1. The user submits a prompt to the system.
2. The controller selects the most appropriate models for the task based on their expertise and availability.
3. The controller generates prompts for each model that are designed to elicit specific information or insights from the model.
4. The controller sends the prompts to the models.
5. The models generate responses to the prompts.
6. The controller aggregates the responses from the models to produce a comprehensive and coherent response to the user's prompt.
7. The controller returns the response to the user.

**Features**
The system includes a number of features that improve the efficiency and accuracy of the orchestration process. These features include:

* **Rate limiting:** The controller implements rate limiting to prevent the models from being overloaded with requests. This ensures that the models are able to respond to requests in a timely manner.
* **Error handling:** The controller handles errors that occur during the orchestration process, and provides feedback to the user if necessary. This helps to ensure that the system is able to provide a consistent and reliable service.
* **Logging:** The controller logs all of the interactions between the models and the controller. This information can be used for debugging and analysis purposes.

**Claims**
The present invention includes the following claims:

1. A system for orchestrating multiple AI models, comprising: a plurality of AI models, each of which is specialized in a particular domain or task; a controller for coordinating the interactions between the models; and a database for storing information about the models, the prompts, and the responses.
