**Technical Field**

The present invention relates generally to the field of artificial intelligence (AI), more specifically, it details a system and method for orchestrating the operation of multiple artificial intelligence models to produce enhanced, synthesized responses from diverse AI technologies.

**Background**

The integration of AI technologies into processing methodologies is a rapidly evolving field. However, leveraging multiple AI systems in a single workflow poses significant challenges, including rate limit management, dynamic response synthesis, and optimization of hardware resources. This invention addresses these challenges by providing a system that efficiently orchestrates multiple AI services, thus creating a novel workflow for generating refined outcomes from disparate AI models.

**Summary of the Invention**

The invention comprises a multi-model AI orchestration system, designated herein as TriLLMOrchestrator, designed to dynamically interact with and synthesize responses from various AI models, including but not limited to OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Generative AI, and local implementations such as Llama. It introduces a novel workflow that incorporates initial response generation, meta-analysis, and hyper-level synthesis across different AI technologies. The system is also designed to respect individual model rate limits and optimize computational resources based on the hardware configuration, including support for Apple Silicon GPU acceleration.

**Detailed Description**

TriLLMOrchestrator initiates a process where a user-provided prompt is processed concurrently by multiple AI models. Each model's response is first collected and then used as input for a subsequent layer of analysis, increasing in depth and synthesis as the process advances through predefined stages (initial, meta, ultra, and hyper responses). Notably, the orchestrator incorporates a mechanism to respect the rate limits of each external AI service, using asynchronous waiting and retry strategies for robust interaction with these APIs.

A significant aspect of the orchestrator is its adaptive hardware optimization, detecting if advanced hardware acceleration (e.g., Apple Silicon's MPS) is available and enabling specific optimizations for efficient computation. This feature represents a pioneering approach to leveraging available compute resources for AI model inference tasks, making the system highly adaptable to diverse deployment environments.

The system utilizes a PromptTemplate dataclass for dynamically generating subsequent prompts based on the responses from previous stages, ensuring context relevance and continuity across the entire orchestration process. Additionally, a RateLimits dataclass is employed for configuring model-specific rate limit adherence, demonstrating an architecture that is both extensible and respectful of external API constraints.
