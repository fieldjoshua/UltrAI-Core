As GIDEON gears up to release its Version 1.0, our pricing strategy is carefully crafted to achieve maximum market penetration while ensuring accessibility for all segments of the criminal defense community. To make our cutting-edge platform accessible to a wide range of users, we will offer flexible, tiered monthly subscriptions with competitive rates that span from $50 to $500 per month for individual attorneys and small firms. Recognizing the budget constraints often encountered by public defenders, we plan to provide discounted rates to these organizations and foster data-sharing partnerships to further enhance their capabilities. By adopting this user-friendly approach, we aim to make GIDEON an indispensable tool for every member of the criminal defense community, regardless of size or resource constraints.
