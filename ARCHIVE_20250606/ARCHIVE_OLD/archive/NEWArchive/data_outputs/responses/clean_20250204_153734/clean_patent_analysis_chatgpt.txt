**Technical Field**

The present invention relates to the technical field of machine learning, particularly orchestration systems for leveraging multiple artificial intelligence (AI) models, including but not limited to generative AI models, for complex data analysis and synthesis tasks.

**Background**

In the rapidly evolving domain of artificial intelligence, the utilization of multiple AI models in a cohesive manner presents both a significant opportunity and a challenge. The orchestration of these models to perform tasks sequentially or in parallel, processing and analyzing data at various levels, and synthesizing the outputs into a cohesive understanding or response, requires innovative approaches. Existing systems often rely on a single AI model or manually coordinate between several models without an efficient or dynamic framework.

**Summary of the Invention**

The invention, referred to as "TriLLMOrchestrator," is an AI model orchestration system designed to integrate and manage the workflow between multiple AI generative models to perform analysis, meta-analysis, and synthesis of data or textual prompts in an automated, cohesive process. This system introduces a novel framework wherein AI models, including but not limited to Google’s Generative AI, OpenAI's models, and local AI processing units, interact sequentially and/or in parallel to process prompts, generate responses, and synthesize these responses at various levels of abstraction.

**Detailed Description**

The TriLLMOrchestrator is implemented through a software system that initializes with specific API keys and configurations for various AI models. It assigns tasks to these models based on a predetermined or dynamically set rate limit and priority, handling the orchestration in a non-blocking, asynchronous manner to enable efficient processing. The system supports multiple output formats and leverages hardware acceleration (such as MPS on Apple Silicon) when available for computational tasks.

Unique aspects of this system include the ability to extract keywords from prompts automatically, generate and save responses from different AI models at initial, meta, and ultra-analysis levels, and perform a "hyper-analysis" that provides a higher-order synthesis of all previous responses. The system is designed to respect the rate limits of external API services, employing retry mechanisms with exponential backoff to handle request failures gracefully.

Additionally, the orchestration process includes a proprietary step to analyze and save its operational metadata and results for patent analysis, demonstrating its capability to participate in self-analysis and documentation generation.
