To improve your circulation and energy levels, consider incorporating these over-the-counter supplements into your daily routine:

* Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): This antioxidant helps generate energy in cells, particularly in the mitochondria. CoQ10 can improve circulation and boost energy levels.
* Fish Oil: Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil have anti-inflammatory properties, which can help improve blood flow and reduce inflammation in the body.
* Ginkgo Biloba: This herb can help improve blood flow to the brain and other parts of the body, leading to increased energy levels and improved mental clarity.
* Vitamin D: Maintaining adequate vitamin D levels is essential for overall health, including circulation and immune function. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to fatigue and low energy levels.

Remember to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplements to ensure they are safe and appropriate for your individual needs.
