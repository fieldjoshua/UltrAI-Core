As a healthy 44-year-old male, you're off to a great start! Maintaining good health and improving your circulation and energy levels can be achieved through a combination of lifestyle changes and supplements. Here are some over-the-counter supplements that may help:

1. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): This antioxidant helps generate energy in cells, particularly in the mitochondria. CoQ10 can help improve circulation and boost energy levels.
2. Fish Oil: Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil have anti-inflammatory properties, which can help improve blood flow and reduce inflammation in the body.
3. Ginkgo Biloba: This herb can help improve blood flow to the brain and other parts of the body, leading to increased energy levels and improved mental clarity.
4. Vitamin D: Maintaining adequate vitamin D levels is essential for overall health, including circulation and immune function. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to fatigue and weakness.
5. Magnesium: This mineral plays a crucial role in muscle relaxation and contraction. It can help improve blood flow and reduce muscle cramps or spasms.
6. Iron: Iron is essential for the production of hemoglobin, which carries oxygen throughout the body. Low iron levels can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased circulation.
7. Ginseng: This herb has been used in traditional medicine for centuries to improve energy and endurance. It can help reduce fatigue and boost circulation.
8. Ashwagandha: This adaptogenic herb can help reduce stress and anxiety, which are common causes of decreased circulation and low energy levels.
9. L-Carnitine: This amino acid plays a crucial role in energy production within the body. It can help improve circulation and boost energy levels.
10. Green Tea Extract: The caffeine and catechins found in green tea extract can help improve circulation, boost metabolism, and increase energy levels.

Remember to consult with your healthcare provider before adding any new supplements to your regimen, especially if you have pre-existing medical conditions or take medications. Start with small doses and gradually increase as needed to avoid any adverse effects.

In addition to supplementation, consider making lifestyle changes such as regular exercise, a balanced diet, adequate sleep, and stress management techniques to support your overall health and well-being.
