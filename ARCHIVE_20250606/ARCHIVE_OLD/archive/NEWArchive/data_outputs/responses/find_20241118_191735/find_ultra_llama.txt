In this response, I have compiled a list of the top 10 peer-reviewed articles on the future of the economy in the context of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). These articles provide insights into the impact of AGI on various aspects of the economy and society, including labor markets, entrepreneurship, innovation, policy implications, and more.

The list includes articles from reputable sources such as Google Scholar, Journal of Economic Perspectives, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Stanford University, and others. Each article provides a comprehensive analysis of the economic impact of AGI and its potential consequences for the future of work, productivity, and prosperity.

By reviewing these articles, policymakers, scholars, and practitioners can gain a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between technology, economy, and society in the age of AGI. This knowledge can help inform decision-making and strategic planning to address potential challenges and harness the benefits of AGI for sustainable economic growth and social well-being.
