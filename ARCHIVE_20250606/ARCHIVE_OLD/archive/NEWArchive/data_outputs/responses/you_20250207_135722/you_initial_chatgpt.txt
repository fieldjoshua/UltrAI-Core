**Applicant:** [Applicant's Name or Company's Name]

**Field**
The present invention relates to artificial intelligence systems, more specifically to a system and method for orchestrating multiple artificial intelligence (AI) models to collaboratively analyze and synthesize information across diverse datasets.

**Background**
The advancement in artificial intelligence has allowed for improved efficiency in data analysis and decision-making processes. However, individual AI models often operate in silos, focusing on specific tasks or types of data. This isolation limits the potential for comprehensive understanding and synthesis of information, which is increasingly necessary in complex decision-making scenarios. There exists a need for a system that can integrate multiple AI models, enabling them to collaborate, share insights, and provide more holistic outcomes.

**Summary of the Invention**
The invention provides a system and method for orchestrating collaborative analysis and synthesis of information by multiple AI models. This system enables the coordination of different AI models, each specialized in distinct aspects of data analysis or possessing expertise in varied data domains, to work together seamlessly. The orchestrated system enhances analytical capabilities, data insights, and decision-making processes by aggregating, analyzing, and synthesizing data from diverse sources in a collaborative manner.
