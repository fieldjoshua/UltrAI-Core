# Plan: Document Processing

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of document processing capabilities in the UltraAI Framework. Document processing is a core functionality that enables users to analyze, extract information from, and utilize document content for AI-enhanced analysis.

## Status

- **Current Phase**: Planning
- **Progress**: 0%
- **Owner**: UltraAI Team
- **Started**: TBD
- **Target Completion**: TBD
- **Authority**: Standard Plan

## Plan Review

### Novelty Verification

This plan does not duplicate any existing work. It focuses specifically on document processing capabilities that are referenced in the Implementation Roadmap but not covered by other functional plans.

### Impact Assessment

This plan impacts several aspects of the UltraAI project:

- Depends on the Backend Integration Plan for storage infrastructure
- Frontend Development Plan will need to incorporate document upload and management UI
- Intelligence Multiplication Plan will utilize document content for context-aware analysis

## Objectives

- Create a robust document processing pipeline for various file formats
- Implement efficient document chunking and embedding strategies
- Develop relevance scoring for document sections
- Build a document management system for storage and retrieval
- Establish a document context interface for AI models

## Background

### Problem Statement

AI models require significant context to generate relevant, high-quality outputs. Document processing enables the extraction and utilization of information from various sources, but needs careful implementation to handle different formats, extract relevant information, and provide it to models in an optimal way.

### Current State

- Basic file upload functionality exists
- No structured document processing pipeline
- Limited support for different file formats
- No semantic search or relevance scoring for document content

### Desired Future State

- Comprehensive document processing pipeline supporting multiple formats
- Intelligent chunking and embedding of document content
- Semantic search and relevance scoring for efficient context retrieval
- Seamless integration with the AI orchestration layer

## Open Questions

- What is the optimal chunking strategy for different document types?
- How should document relevance be scored and ranked?
- What embedding models provide the best balance of performance and accuracy?
- How should documents be stored for efficient retrieval?
