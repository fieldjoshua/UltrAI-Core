# DockerComposeSetup Action Plan

## Status

- **Current Status:** PendingApproval
- **Progress:** 0%
- **Last Updated:** 2025-05-02

## Objective

Create a comprehensive Docker Compose setup for local development that includes Redis and PostgreSQL services, enabling developers to quickly set up a consistent development environment with all required services.

## Background

The Ultra project currently lacks a standardized development environment setup, making it difficult for new developers to get started and potentially causing inconsistencies between development and production environments. Docker Compose provides a way to define and run multi-container Docker applications, which would streamline the setup process and ensure all developers work with the same service configurations.

## Steps

1. **Audit Current Infrastructure Requirements**

   - [ ] Document all external services used by Ultra (Redis, PostgreSQL, etc.)
   - [ ] Identify specific version requirements for each service
   - [ ] Determine optimal configuration parameters for development

2. **Design Docker Compose Architecture**

   - [ ] Create container architecture diagram
   - [ ] Define network configuration for inter-service communication
   - [ ] Plan volume mounts for data persistence
   - [ ] Determine environment variable strategy

3. **Implement Base Docker Compose File**

   - [ ] Set up PostgreSQL service with appropriate extensions and initial schemas
   - [ ] Configure Redis service with development-appropriate settings
   - [ ] Create a service for the Ultra backend with hot-reloading
   - [ ] Set up a service for the Ultra frontend with development server

4. **Configure Service Dependencies**

   - [ ] Implement proper startup order with dependency checks
   - [ ] Create health checks for each service
   - [ ] Configure networking between services
   - [ ] Set up shared volumes where needed

5. **Add Development Utilities**

   - [ ] Include database administration tools (pgAdmin or similar)
   - [ ] Add Redis management interface
   - [ ] Configure logging aggregation for all services
   - [ ] Set up convenient volume mapping for code editing

6. **Create Initialization Scripts**

   - [ ] Develop database initialization scripts
   - [ ] Create seed data scripts for development
   - [ ] Implement service readiness checks
   - [ ] Add database migration initialization

7. **Documentation and Guides**

   - [ ] Create detailed README with setup instructions
   - [ ] Document all available services and their purposes
   - [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common issues
   - [ ] Include performance optimization tips

8. **Testing**
   - [ ] Verify setup on different operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows)
   - [ ] Test scaling of services
   - [ ] Validate data persistence across restarts
   - [ ] Ensure compatibility with CI/CD workflows

## Success Criteria

- Developers can start a complete development environment with a single command
- All necessary services (Redis, PostgreSQL) are properly configured and accessible
- Data persists between container restarts
- Development workflow is optimized with hot-reloading and debugging tools
- Documentation provides clear instructions for common development tasks
- Setup works consistently across different developer operating systems

## Technical Requirements

- Docker Compose file uses version 3 or later
- All images used are from trusted sources with specific version tags
- Container security best practices are followed
- Resource limits are configured for development machines
- Environment variable examples are provided without exposing sensitive data

## Dependencies

- Docker and Docker Compose must be installed on developer machines
- Network access to Docker Hub or other container registries

## Timeline

- Start: TBD (After approval)
- Target Completion: TBD + 6 days
- Estimated Duration: 6 days

## Notes

This action will significantly improve developer onboarding experience and ensure consistent development environments. While primarily focused on local development, the Docker Compose setup can later be extended to support staging and testing environments as well.
