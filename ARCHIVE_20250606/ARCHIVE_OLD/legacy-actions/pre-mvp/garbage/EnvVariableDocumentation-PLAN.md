# EnvVariableDocumentation Action Plan

## Status

- **Current Status:** PendingApproval
- **Progress:** 0%
- **Last Updated:** 2025-05-02

## Objective

Create comprehensive documentation for all environment variables used in the Ultra project to improve setup experience, reduce configuration errors, and ensure consistent deployment across different environments.

## Background

The Ultra project uses various environment variables for configuration, but their documentation is currently incomplete or scattered across different files. This makes it difficult for new team members to set up the project correctly and can lead to misconfiguration in different environments. A centralized, detailed documentation of all environment variables will significantly improve the developer experience and system reliability.

## Steps

1. **Audit Current Environment Variables**

   - [ ] Review all code files to identify environment variable usage
   - [ ] Document current env.example file contents
   - [ ] Check configuration loading mechanisms in the codebase
   - [ ] Identify inconsistencies or undocumented variables

2. **Categorize Environment Variables**

   - [ ] Group variables by component (backend, frontend, services)
   - [ ] Identify required vs. optional variables
   - [ ] Categorize by functionality (database, API keys, feature flags, etc.)
   - [ ] Note environment-specific variables (dev, test, prod)

3. **Document Variable Details**

   - [ ] Create standardized documentation format for each variable
   - [ ] Document purpose, expected format, and default values
   - [ ] Include examples of valid values
   - [ ] Note dependencies between variables
   - [ ] Document security implications of each variable

4. **Create Comprehensive Environment Templates**

   - [ ] Create updated env.example with all variables
   - [ ] Add detailed comments for each variable in the template
   - [ ] Develop environment templates for different deployment scenarios
   - [ ] Include validation rules where applicable

5. **Develop Configuration Validation**

   - [ ] Create a script to validate environment configuration
   - [ ] Implement checks for required variables
   - [ ] Add format validation for critical variables
   - [ ] Develop warnings for potentially problematic configurations

6. **Update Documentation**

   - [ ] Create a dedicated environment variable section in project documentation
   - [ ] Add quick reference guide for common configurations
   - [ ] Document troubleshooting steps for environment-related issues
   - [ ] Create setup guides for different hosting environments

7. **Update README and Onboarding Materials**
   - [ ] Add environment setup section to main README
   - [ ] Update developer onboarding documentation
   - [ ] Create quickstart guide with minimal required configuration
   - [ ] Add links to detailed documentation

## Success Criteria

- All environment variables are comprehensively documented
- Documentation includes purpose, format, examples, and security considerations for each variable
- Updated env.example file reflects all available configuration options
- Validation script can detect common configuration errors
- Documentation is organized by component and deployment scenario
- Improved developer experience when setting up the project

## Technical Requirements

- Documentation follows consistent format for all variables
- Sensitive values are properly masked in examples
- Configuration validation respects backward compatibility
- Documentation is accessible and easy to navigate

## Dependencies

- None

## Timeline

- Start: TBD (After approval)
- Target Completion: TBD + 4 days
- Estimated Duration: 4 days

## Notes

This action prioritizes developer experience and system reliability by ensuring all configuration options are well-documented. While it focuses primarily on documentation, the addition of validation scripts will help prevent configuration errors before they cause runtime issues.
