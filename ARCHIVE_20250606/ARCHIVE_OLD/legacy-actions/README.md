## Archive Structure

### batch-created-may21/
Actions that were bulk-created on May 21, 2025 with no actual implementation work. These appear to have been auto-generated from a planning document.

### pre-mvp/
Actions created before the MVP development phase (pre-May 16, 2025) that are no longer relevant to the production system.

### old-naming-convention/
Actions using the deprecated ALL_CAPS naming convention (e.g., API_DEVELOPMENT, FRONTEND_DEVELOPMENT).

### duplicates/
Actions that duplicate functionality of other actions or represent multiple attempts at the same feature.

## Preservation Notes

These actions have been archived to:
1. Maintain historical context of the project development
2. Reduce clutter in the active actions directory
3. Focus current work on MVP-critical tasks
4. Preserve any valuable research or documentation

Actions can be restored if needed by moving them back to `.aicheck/actions/`.
