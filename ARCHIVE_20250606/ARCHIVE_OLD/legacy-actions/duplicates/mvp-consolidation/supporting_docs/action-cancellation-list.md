# Action Cancellation List - MVP Focus

**Date**: 2025-05-21
**Reason**: Focus on MVP completion, eliminate feature creep

## Actions to Cancel (12 total)

### Non-Essential Enhancements (5)
1. **FeatherPatternExpansion** - Advanced analysis patterns, not MVP critical
2. **TrainingRecommendations** - Nice-to-have feature, post-MVP
3. **AutomatedQualityDashboards** - Monitoring enhancement, not core functionality
4. **InteractiveDependencyGraphs** - Visualization enhancement, post-MVP
5. **StyleUpdate** - UI polish, not MVP requirement

### Obsolete/Fixed Issues (3)
6. **fix-minimal-deployment** - Deployment is working correctly
7. **fix-render-deployment-errors** - Production is stable and healthy
8. **FixFinalIntegrationBugs** - No critical integration bugs identified

### Premature Optimization (2)
9. **FinalPolish** - Premature, MVP should ship first for user feedback
10. **MVPTestCoverageCompleted** - Redundant with completed MVPTestCoverage

### Administrative/Meta (2)
11. **ActionManagementTest** - Test action, not production requirement
12. **AdminAudit** - Administrative process, not user-facing MVP

## Preservation Strategy

**Documentation Saved**: All supporting documentation from cancelled actions moved to:
- `.aicheck/actions/cancelled/[action-name]/` (for reference)
- Key insights captured in mvp-consolidation supporting docs

**Ideas for Later**: Valuable concepts from cancelled actions documented in:
- `post-mvp-enhancement-backlog.md`
- Can be revived post-MVP with proper justification

## Impact Assessment

**Risk**: Low - No core MVP functionality affected
**Benefit**: High - 67% reduction in action management overhead
**Resource Savings**: Eliminates ~40 hours of non-essential work

## Post-MVP Revival Process

For any cancelled action to be revived:
1. Must demonstrate user demand or business value
2. Must not duplicate existing functionality
3. Must include proper scoped plan and timeline
4. Must be justified against other priorities
