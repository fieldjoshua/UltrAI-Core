# DockerizedOrchestrator Action Plan

## Overview

This action focuses on setting up the existing LLM orchestration system to work in the Docker environment, ensuring it reproduces the current functionality without adding unnecessary complexity.

## Objectives

1. Configure Docker environment variables for LLM access
2. Ensure orchestrator code is properly mounted in Docker containers
3. Verify that the existing LLM/analysis features work in Docker
4. Document the Docker-based setup for the orchestrator

## Value to Program

This action enhances the UltrAI program by:

- Making the orchestrator fully compatible with the Docker development environment
- Ensuring consistent behavior between local and containerized deployments
- Enabling easier team collaboration through standardized environments
- Creating a foundation for more advanced containerized deployments

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Docker Configuration

1. Review current Docker Compose setup
2. Add appropriate environment variables for LLM API keys
3. Update volume mappings to include orchestrator code
4. Ensure Python import paths are correctly configured

### Phase 2: Orchestrator Verification

1. Test basic orchestrator functionality in Docker environment
2. Verify LLM provider connectivity
3. Test each analysis module with sample prompts
4. Ensure logs and errors are properly captured

### Phase 3: Documentation

1. Create setup guide for Docker-based orchestrator usage
2. Document environment variables and their purposes
3. Create troubleshooting section for common issues
4. Provide example commands and expected outputs

## Dependencies

- Existing orchestrator codebase
- Docker and Docker Compose installation
- LLM API keys (or mock mode configuration)

## Success Criteria

1. Orchestrator runs successfully in Docker environment
2. All LLM providers can be accessed (or mocked appropriately)
3. Analysis modules produce expected results
4. Documentation is clear and complete
5. Setup can be reproduced by other team members

## Timeline

- Phase 1: 1 day
- Phase 2: 1 day
- Phase 3: 1 day

## Status

- Current Status: ActiveAction
- Progress: 60%
- Last Updated: 2025-05-04

## Notes

This action takes a minimalist approach, focusing on making the existing orchestrator functionality work in the Docker environment without adding new features or interfaces. It creates a foundation for more advanced containerized deployments in the future.
