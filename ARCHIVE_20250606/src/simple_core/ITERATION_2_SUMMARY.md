# Simple Core Orchestrator - Iteration 2 Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the second iteration of the Simple Core Orchestrator, focusing on adding enhanced capabilities for multi-stage processing.

## Key Features Added

1. **Multi-stage Processing**

   - **Initial Responses**: Get responses from multiple LLM providers
   - **Meta-Analysis**: Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each response
   - **Synthesis**: Create an optimized response combining the best elements

2. **Quality-based Model Selection**

   - Quality metrics service to evaluate responses
   - Response selection based on quality scores
   - Fallback to priority-based selection when quality metrics unavailable

3. **Advanced Prompt Templates**

   - Specialized templates for each processing stage
   - Configurable templates for customization
   - System prompt support

4. **Response Caching**
   - Simple in-memory cache with TTL
   - Cache key generation based on prompts and configuration
   - Thread-safe implementation with asyncio locks

## Architecture

The enhanced orchestrator builds on the foundation of the basic orchestrator (Iteration 1) by adding the following components:

1. **EnhancedOrchestrator**: Core orchestration logic for multi-stage processing
2. **PromptTemplates**: Templates for different stages of processing
3. **QualityMetrics**: Metrics for evaluating response quality
4. **CacheService**: Simple in-memory cache for responses

## Data Flow

1. **Request Received**

   - Check cache for existing response
   - Format initial prompt using templates

2. **Stage 1: Initial Responses**

   - Send prompt to all configured LLM models in parallel
   - Collect and evaluate responses using quality metrics

3. **Stage 2: Meta-Analysis**

   - Format meta-analysis prompt with initial responses
   - Send to selected meta-analysis models
   - Collect meta-analyses

4. **Stage 3: Synthesis**

   - Format synthesis prompt with responses and analyses
   - Send to synthesis model
   - Generate final synthesized response

5. **Response Selection**
   - Select best individual response based on quality
   - Return comprehensive result with all stages

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Quality Metrics**

   - Model-based evaluation of responses
   - External reference data for factual accuracy

2. **Response Streaming**

   - Streaming support for real-time responses
   - Progressive updates during processing

3. **Sophisticated Caching**

   - Distributed cache with Redis
   - Partial result caching

4. **Context Management**
   - Multi-turn conversation support
   - Context window optimization
