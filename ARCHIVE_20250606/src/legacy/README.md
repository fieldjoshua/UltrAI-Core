# Legacy Files

This directory contains files that were duplicates or inconsistent with the new module structure.
These files are preserved for reference but should not be used in new development.

The core functionality has been reorganized into the appropriate module directories:

- Core functionality: /src/core
- Models: /src/models
- Patterns: /src/patterns
- etc.

If you need to reference these files, please consider updating your code to use the new structure.
