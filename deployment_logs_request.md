# Render Deployment Logs Request

To properly debug the SQLAlchemy deployment issue as outlined in the mvp-minimal-deployment ACTION plan, we need:

1. **Full deployment logs from Render including**:

   - Complete error traceback (not just "No module named 'sqlalchemy'")
   - pip install output showing what packages are being installed
   - Which requirements file is being used (requirements-render.txt?)
   - The exact build command Render is executing

2. **Configuration clarity**:

   - Which config file is Render using? (render.yaml or render-prod.yaml?)
   - What's the actual build command in the Render dashboard?

3. **Environment details**:
   - Python version used by Render
   - Any system packages or dependencies

Without this information, we're "blind debugging" as noted in the ACTION plan and can't make meaningful progress.

Please share the complete deployment logs from the Render dashboard.
