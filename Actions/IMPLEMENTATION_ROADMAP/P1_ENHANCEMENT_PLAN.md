| Operational challenges | Medium | Medium | Regular operational reviews |

## Success Criteria

The P1 Enhancement Phase will be considered successful when:

1. Performance meets or exceeds defined metrics
2. Documentation is complete and up-to-date
3. Deployment process is automated and reliable
4. Monitoring and logging are fully operational
5. Backup and recovery procedures are tested
6. Incident response process is validated
7. All components are properly integrated

## Next Steps
