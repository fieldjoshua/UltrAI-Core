## Dependencies

| Component | Depends On | Must Complete Before |
|-----------|------------|----------------------|
| Core Components Definition | None | All other components |
| Development Environment Setup | Core Components Definition | Basic System Structure |
| Basic System Structure | Development Environment Setup | N/A |

## Resources Required

- **Personnel**:
  - System Architecture Lead
  - Development Team

- **Tools**:
  - Development Environment
  - Version Control
  - Testing Framework
  - Documentation Tools

- **Time Commitment**:
  - Full-time for all team members
  - 1 week total duration

## Success Criteria

The Core System Architecture action will be considered successful when:

1. All core components are defined and documented
2. Development environment is set up and working
3. Basic system structure is established
4. Team can begin implementation

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Component integration issues | High | Medium | Regular integration testing |
| Development environment problems | Medium | Low | Clear setup documentation |
| Interface definition gaps | High | Low | Regular review sessions |

## Approval

| Role | Name | Approval Date |
|------|------|---------------|
| Action Owner | [Name] | [Date] |
| Technical Reviewer | [Name] | [Date] |
| Project Lead | [Name] | [Date] |

## Revision History

| Version | Date | Description | Author |
|---------|------|-------------|--------|
| 1.0 | 2025-04-25 | Initial draft | UltraAI Team |
