Maintaining good health and improving circulation and energy levels can indeed be supported by a balanced diet, regular exercise, and appropriate supplementation. However, it's always best to consult with a healthcare provider before adding new supplements to your regimen, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking medications, as they can provide personalized advice based on your health history.

That said, several over-the-counter supplements are popular for supporting circulation, energy levels, and overall good health. Here are some that have garnered interest for their potential benefits:

1. **Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** Found in fish oil supplements, omega-3 fatty acids can help improve heart health and circulation. They have been shown to reduce triglyceride levels, lower blood pressure slightly, and reduce the risk of heart disease.

2. **Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10):** CoQ10 is an antioxidant that cells use for growth and maintenance. Levels of CoQ10 decrease with age. Supplements might help with energy production and improve exercise performance and circulation.

3. **Magnesium:** Important for many processes in the body, magnesium can help regulate muscle and nerve function, blood sugar levels, and blood pressure. It might also improve sleep quality, which can, in turn, support energy levels.

4. **Vitamin B12:** Especially important for those following a vegetarian or vegan diet, Vitamin B12 supplements can help prevent anemia, which can cause fatigue and weakness. B12 is crucial for energy production at the cellular level.

5. **Iron:** Especially if you are prone to anemia, iron supplements can increase your energy levels by improving the blood's ability to carry oxygen. Again, it’s important to check with a healthcare professional before starting iron supplements because too much can be harmful.

6. **L-arginine:** This amino acid is converted in the body into nitric oxide, which helps blood vessels open wider for improved blood flow. It may support healthy circulation, but evidence is mixed, and there are potential side effects, so caution and professional guidance are advisable.

7. **Ginseng:** Often used in traditional medicine, ginseng may help improve energy levels. Studies on its efficacy for energy and exercise performance have been mixed but generally positive.

8. **Ashwagandha:** An adaptogen that may help reduce stress, improve energy levels, and support overall health. It’s also thought to have a number of other health benefits, from reducing anxiety and stress to improving brain function.

It's important to start with a foundation of a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular physical activity, adequate sleep, and stress management, alongside any supplement regimen. Always research the quality of supplements and choose reputable brands, as dietary supplements are not strictly regulated like pharmaceutical drugs in many countries. Moreover, discuss with your healthcare provider to ensure these supplements are safe for you and won't interfere with any medications you might be taking.
