**Technical Field**

The present invention relates to a system and method for orchestrating multiple AI models to generate comprehensive and insightful responses to complex user prompts.

**Background**

Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool for processing and generating human-like text. However, individual AI models often have limitations in terms of their scope and depth of understanding. To overcome these limitations, it is desirable to combine the capabilities of multiple AI models in a coordinated manner.

**Summary of the Invention**

The present invention provides a system and method for orchestrating multiple AI models to generate comprehensive and insightful responses to complex user prompts. The system includes a prompt processor that analyzes the user prompt to extract key concepts and intentions. The system then selects a set of AI models that are best suited to address the specific requirements of the prompt. The selected AI models are then executed in a sequence, with the output of each model being used as input for the next model. The final output of the system is a comprehensive and insightful response that leverages the unique strengths of each AI model.

**Detailed Description**

The present invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.

**Figure 1** is a block diagram of the system according to the present invention. The system includes a prompt processor 10, a model selector 20, an AI model executor 30, and a response generator 40.

The prompt processor 10 receives the user prompt as input. The prompt processor 10 analyzes the prompt to extract key concepts and intentions. The prompt processor 10 then generates a set of parameters that define the specific requirements of the prompt.

The model selector 20 receives the parameters from the prompt processor 10. The model selector 20 selects a set of AI models that are best suited to address the specific requirements of the prompt. The model selector 20 considers factors such as the domain expertise, language proficiency, and reasoning capabilities of each AI model.

The AI model executor 30 receives the selected AI models from the model selector 20. The AI model executor 30 executes the selected AI models in a sequence. The output of each AI model is passed as input to the next AI model in the sequence.

The response generator 40 receives the output of the last AI model in the sequence. The response generator 40 generates a comprehensive and insightful response based on the output of the AI models. The response generator 40 considers factors such as the coherence, consistency, and relevance of the output from the AI models.
