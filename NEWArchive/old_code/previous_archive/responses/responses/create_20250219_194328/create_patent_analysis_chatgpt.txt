### Technical Field
The present invention pertains to the field of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically an advanced orchestration system for integrating, managing, and synthesizing responses from multiple AI models to produce a comprehensive analysis or solution based on an initial user prompt.

### Background 
AI models, particularly those based on deep learning, have shown remarkable capabilities in tasks such as natural language processing, image recognition, and decision making. Despite their power, individual models often have limitations in scope and understanding, leading to responses that might lack depth, breadth, or insight when tackling complex or multi-faceted queries. There exists a need for an orchestration mechanism that not only leverages the strengths of individual AI models but also synthesizes their outputs to provide enriched, comprehensive, and insightful responses.

### Summary of the Invention
The invention, referred to as TriLLMOrchestrator, introduces a novel system and method for orchestrating interactions among multiple AI models to enhance the depth and quality of their collective output. By leveraging an orchestrated workflow, the system synthesizes initial responses from diverse models, conducts meta-analyses, and produces ultra and hyper-level insights. This multi-tiered approach allows for the extraction of nuanced understanding and generates a synthesis that is greater than the sum of individual model outputs.

### Detailed Description
The TriLLMOrchestrator comprises several key components and methods:

1. **Initialization and Configuration**: The system initializes with API keys for different AI models, rate limits, output formats, and a choice of ultra engine, ensuring secure and efficient operation.
   
2. **Multi-model Integration**: It integrates with several AI services, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's generative AI models, and a local Llama model, allowing for a diverse range of insights.
   
3. **Rate Limiting and Asynchronous Requests**: Through asyncio and tenacity for retrying failed requests, the system respects the rate limits of different APIs and efficiently manages requests in parallel, ensuring timely response synthesis without overwhelming the services.
   
4. **Advanced Processing Workflow**: The TriLLMOrchestrator employs a unique workflow:
    a. **Initial Responses**: Collecting initial responses from all integrated models based on the user's prompt.
    b. **Meta-analysis**: Synthesizing initial responses to create a more refined query, which is then sent to all models.
    c. **Ultra Response**: Further synthesizing meta-responses to develop a deep, comprehensive understanding.
    d. **Hyper Analysis**: Performing a final synthesis to identify emergent patterns, insights, and recommendations. This leverages a "hyper-level" analysis, synthesizing all previous layers of analysis.

5. **Dynamic Prompt Templates**: Utilizes customizable prompt templates for different stages of synthesis, increasing the flexibility and adaptability of AI interactions.
