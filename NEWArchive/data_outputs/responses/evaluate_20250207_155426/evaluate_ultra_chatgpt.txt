**Final Synthesis: Advancing AGI with Multimodal AI Model Orchestrators**

The exploration into the realm of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) identifies a multimodal AI model orchestrator as a pivotal innovation for surmounting current technological thresholds. This orchestrator unifies the disparate strands of AI models—encompassing natural language processing, image recognition, decision-making algorithms, and more—under a single operational framework. The fusion of these varied capabilities unfolds a new dimension of cognitive computing that potentially eclipses the notion of AGI as merely an extension of current AI capabilities. 

**Strategic Insights and Advantages**

The collective intelligence paradigm crucially amplifies system capabilities, achieving a synergetic integration that transcends the sum of its parts. This harmonized intelligence is adept at navigating complex issues with heightened adaptability and strategic depth, leveraging concurrent insights across domains. Additionally, the orchestrator champions resource efficiency by judiciously allocating computational tasks, thereby fostering a sustainable pathway towards scalable AGI development.

Innovation benefits from this orchestrated approach as well. By fostering a dynamic environment where models learn from one another, the system sparks cross-disciplinary advancements, enlarging the cognitive footprint of AI systems. This, in turn, facilitates the inception of novel algorithms and approaches to problem-solving.

**Implementation Challenges and Considerations**

However, realizing this architecture's full potential entails navigating a suite of formidable obstacles. Integration complexity stands as a significant barrier, mandating a cohesive system design that can seamlessly blend models with divergent operational paradigms. Moreover, this orchestrated system must evolve, leveraging continuous learning from cross-modal interactions to refine and enhance its capabilities over time.

Ethical and oversight concerns are magnified in this context. The orchestrator's expansive capabilities necessitate a foundational ethical framework to address critical issues of transparency, accountability, and bias mitigation. Operational oversight is indispensable to steer these powerful systems within ethically acceptable boundaries.

**Pathways to Implementation**

A balanced approach to implementation underscores the selective integration of AI models, emphasizing complementarity and the overarching AGI objectives. Advanced learning strategies, including meta-learning and ensemble methods, are essential for augmenting system adaptability and efficiency. Furthermore, embedding mechanisms for human-AI collaboration can guide the orchestrator towards ethically sound and pragmatically viable outcomes.

**Conclusion**

The notion of a multimodal AI model orchestrator represents a bold leap towards concretizing AGI. By architecting systems that aggregate the strengths of diverse AI disciplines, we edge closer to surpassing the current limitations of artificial intelligence. However, this journey is equally laden with technological, ethical, and practical challenges that necessitate thoughtful consideration and strategic planning. With a committed approach to addressing these challenges, the vision of AGI through multimodal orchestrators not only remains attainable but also augurs a transformative phase in the evolution of cognitive computing technologies.
