# IterativeOrchestratorBuild Action Plan (1 of 16)

## Overview

**Status:** Not Started
**Created:** 2025-05-03
**Last Updated:** 2025-05-03
**Expected Completion:** 2025-05-10

## Goal

Create a modular, iterative LLM orchestration system that simplifies the current implementation while maintaining all core functionality. The orchestrator should efficiently coordinate multiple LLM requests, handle response synthesis, and provide clear extension points for future development.

## Value to Program

This action directly addresses core functionality issues in the Ultra system by:

1. Replacing the complex, difficult-to-maintain orchestration system with a cleaner, more modular implementation
2. Creating clear interfaces between components to simplify future extensions
3. Implementing an iterative development approach that delivers working functionality at each stage
4. Reducing technical debt by consolidating duplicate code paths into a single orchestration system
5. Enabling more efficient scaling when adding new LLM providers or analysis techniques

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create a simplified `BaseOrchestrator` with core functionality that supports:

  - Sending prompts to multiple LLMs in parallel
  - Handling errors and retries gracefully
  - Supporting mock mode for development without API keys
  - Synthesizing responses with a configurable "ultra" model

- [ ] Implement an `EnhancedOrchestrator` that extends the base functionality with:

  - Document attachment and processing
  - LLM model selection
  - Analysis pattern selection
  - Caching for efficiency
  - Detailed logging and metrics

- [ ] Provide a clear migration path from existing orchestration to the new system

- [ ] Create comprehensive tests demonstrating functionality with and without actual LLM connections

- [ ] Document the architecture, responsibilities, and extension points of the orchestrator

- [ ] Provide example usage through a simple command-line interface

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-2)

1. Create a modular `BaseOrchestrator` class with:

   - Clear configuration options
   - Async processing for parallel LLM requests
   - Simple response synthesis
   - Built-in mock support

2. Extract common utilities from existing codebase:

   - LLM client adapters
   - Error handling
   - Configuration management

3. Implement a minimal CLI to test the orchestrator

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Days 3-4)

1. Develop the `EnhancedOrchestrator` with:

   - Support for document processing
   - Multiple analysis patterns
   - Response templating
   - Detailed logging

2. Create adapters for existing API endpoints to use the new orchestrator

3. Add comprehensive test suite

### Phase 3: Integration (Days 5-7)

1. Update existing endpoints to use the new orchestrator

2. Create migration guide for developers

3. Update documentation to reflect the new architecture

4. Validate all MVP functionality works with the new orchestrator

## Dependencies

- Existing LLM adapters in `src/models/llm_adapter.py`
- Configuration service in `backend/services/llm_config_service.py`
- Mock service in `backend/services/mock_llm_service.py`

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk                                 | Impact | Mitigation                                                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Breaking existing API integrations   | High   | Provide backward compatibility layer, implement comprehensive testing     |
| Performance degradation              | Medium | Benchmark against existing system, optimize iteratively                   |
| Missing edge cases in error handling | Medium | Create extensive test scenarios with simulated failures                   |
| Incomplete feature parity            | High   | Create feature checklist and validate each against current implementation |

## Technical Design

The orchestrator will follow a layered architecture:

1. **Core Layer** - Handles fundamental LLM orchestration

   - LLM client management
   - Parallel request processing
   - Basic response synthesis
   - Error handling

2. **Enhancement Layer** - Adds advanced features

   - Document processing
   - Analysis pattern selection
   - Caching
   - Detailed metrics

3. **Integration Layer** - Connects to existing systems
   - API endpoint adapters
   - Configuration mapping
   - Legacy support
