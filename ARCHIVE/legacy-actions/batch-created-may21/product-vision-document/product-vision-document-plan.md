# ProductVisionDocument Action Plan

## Objective

Create a comprehensive product vision document for UltrAI that captures the essence of what the product offers to users, the key features, and the overall user experience, without focusing on technical implementation details.

## Value to Project

This document will serve as a guiding star for all future development efforts, ensuring that every action and feature implementation aligns with the product's core vision and mission. It will provide clarity on what UltrAI aims to achieve for its users and stakeholders.

## Tasks

1. **Codebase Analysis**
   - Review frontend components to understand the user interface
   - Analyze backend routes and services to identify core features
   - Examine existing documentation to gather product information
   - Study middleware, API endpoints, and configuration for feature insights

2. **Feature Inventory**
   - Create a comprehensive list of all existing features
   - Categorize features by functional area (document processing, LLM integration, etc.)
   - Identify the primary user-facing capabilities
   - Document any planned but unimplemented features referenced in the codebase

3. **User Experience Mapping**
   - Describe the end-to-end user journey
   - Outline key user flows and interactions
   - Identify the core value propositions from a user perspective
   - Document the primary use cases supported by the product

4. **Vision Document Creation**
   - Draft a high-level product vision statement
   - Detail the product features in user-centric terms
   - Describe the ideal user experience
   - Outline future growth areas and expansion opportunities
   - Create visualizations or mockups of key user journeys (if appropriate)

5. **Review and Refinement**
   - Present the document for stakeholder review
   - Incorporate feedback and refinements
   - Finalize the document for use in guiding future development

## Deliverables

1. **`.aicheck/docs/product_vision.md`**: The primary product vision document
2. **Supporting materials**: Any diagrams, user journey maps, or other visual aids
3. **Feature inventory**: A structured catalog of UltrAI's features with user-centric descriptions
4. **Core user flows**: Documentation of the primary ways users interact with UltrAI

## Success Criteria

- The vision document clearly communicates what UltrAI is and offers to users
- The document focuses on user experience rather than technical implementation
- All major features are documented from a user perspective
- The document can be used to evaluate and prioritize future development efforts
- Non-technical stakeholders can understand the product vision

## Timeline

- Day 1-2: Codebase analysis and feature inventory
- Day 3-4: User experience mapping
- Day 5-6: Draft vision document creation
- Day 7: Review, refinement, and finalization

## Notes

This action intentionally focuses on the "what" and "why" of UltrAI rather than the "how." The goal is to create a document that captures the essence of UltrAI from a user's perspective, which can then guide technical implementation decisions.

The final document should be accessible to non-technical stakeholders while still providing sufficient detail to guide technical development efforts.
