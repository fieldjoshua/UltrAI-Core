# Day 4: Deployment Verification Plan

## Date: 2025-05-16

### Objectives

1. Verify Docker configuration and images
2. Validate environment variable setup
3. Test database connectivity and migrations
4. Check Redis cache configuration
5. Validate docker-compose orchestration
6. Test health check endpoints
7. Verify monitoring and logging setup
8. Assess production readiness

### Test Categories

#### 1. Docker Configuration
- [ ] Docker daemon running
- [ ] Ultra Docker images built
- [ ] Dockerfile validity
- [ ] docker-compose.yml configuration

#### 2. Environment Variables
- [ ] Required variables documented
- [ ] Production configuration exists
- [ ] Current environment validation
- [ ] Optional variables check

#### 3. Database Connectivity
- [ ] PostgreSQL connection test
- [ ] Migration files present
- [ ] Alembic configuration
- [ ] Database schema validation

#### 4. Redis Connectivity
- [ ] Redis connection test
- [ ] Basic operations test
- [ ] Cache functionality
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms

#### 5. Docker Compose
- [ ] Configuration validation
- [ ] Service definitions
- [ ] Volume persistence
- [ ] Network configuration

#### 6. Health Endpoints
- [ ] Local health check
- [ ] Service status checks
- [ ] Dependency health
- [ ] Response time validation

#### 7. Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Logging configuration
- [ ] Metrics endpoints
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry)
- [ ] Performance monitoring

#### 8. Production Readiness
- [ ] Security configuration
- [ ] Database production config
- [ ] Redis production config
- [ ] API key configuration

### Critical Deployment Criteria

For deployment to be considered ready:

1. **Must Pass**:
   - Docker configuration valid
   - Database connectivity established
   - Health endpoints responsive
   - Security properly configured

2. **Should Pass**:
   - Redis connectivity
   - Monitoring setup
   - All environment variables set
   - Docker compose fully configured

3. **Nice to Have**:
   - Error tracking configured
   - Metrics collection active
   - Performance monitoring

### Deployment Checklist

- [ ] All Docker images built successfully
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] Database migrations ready to run
- [ ] Health checks passing
- [ ] Security features enabled
- [ ] Monitoring configured
- [ ] Backup strategy in place
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

### Expected Outcomes

1. Comprehensive deployment verification report
2. List of critical issues to address
3. Production readiness assessment
4. Go/no-go recommendation
5. Deployment preparation checklist

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Missing security configuration, no database connectivity
- **Medium Risk**: No Redis, limited monitoring, missing migrations
- **Low Risk**: No error tracking, missing optional features

### Success Criteria

The deployment will be considered successful if:
- 80%+ tests pass
- No critical failures
- All security features enabled
- Database and core services operational
- Health checks responsive
