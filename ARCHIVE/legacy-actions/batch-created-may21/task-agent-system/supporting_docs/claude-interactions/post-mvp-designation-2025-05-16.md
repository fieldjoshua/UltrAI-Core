# Claude Interaction Log

**Date**: 2025-05-16
**ACTION**: TaskAgentSystem
**Purpose**: Update TaskAgentSystem as Post-MVP priority
**Template Used**: N/A - User priority adjustment
**Prompt Hash**: N/A

## Prompt

"ok cool. create the action and plan but designate it as a post mvp priority"

## Response

Updated the TaskAgentSystem plan to reflect Post-MVP status:

1. Changed Priority from "High" to "Post-MVP"
2. Added explicit MVP status: "No - This is a post-MVP enhancement"
3. Added MVPCompletion to dependencies
4. Added note in Executive Summary explaining this is a post-MVP enhancement
5. Updated timeline to indicate "Post-MVP Implementation Timeline"
6. Added target start date as "After MVP completion and initial production deployment"

## Modifications

- Updated version to 1.2
- Changed priority designation
- Added MVP status field
- Enhanced executive summary with post-MVP note
- Modified timeline section
- Updated dependencies

## Verification

- Checked MVP requirements document to confirm this is not needed for MVP
- Verified current MVP focus on basic orchestration is sufficient
- Ensured plan reflects proper post-MVP positioning

## Iterations

[Number of attempts: 1]
[Reason for iterations: User clarification on priority]

## Key Decision Points

1. **MVP Scope**: Basic orchestration already implemented is sufficient for MVP
2. **Complexity**: TaskAgentSystem adds significant architectural complexity not needed initially
3. **Timeline**: 6-week implementation would delay MVP delivery
4. **Value**: Best positioned as major enhancement after MVP success
5. **Dependencies**: Requires MVP completion before implementation
