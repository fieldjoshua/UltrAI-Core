# Plan: Codebase Reorganization

## Overview

This plan outlines the approach for reorganizing the UltraAI codebase to align with the documentation structure established in the Documentation Repopulation plan. It establishes a clear, maintainable directory structure that ensures code is properly organized by function and makes the relationships between components explicit.

## Status

- **Current Phase**: Planning
- **Progress**: 0%
- **Owner**: UltraAI Team
- **Started**: [Current Date]
- **Target Completion**: [Current Date + 2 weeks]
- **Authority**: Standard Plan

## Plan Review

### Novelty Verification

This plan does not duplicate any existing work. It builds upon the Documentation Repopulation plan, which focused on documentation structure, to extend the same principles to code organization.

### Impact Assessment

This plan impacts the entire UltraAI codebase structure. It depends on the Documentation Repopulation plan for guidance on organization principles and ensures the code structure aligns with the action-based documentation approach.

## Objectives

- Establish a clear, functional directory structure for all code components
- Migrate code from legacy directories to the new structure
- Ensure all code is properly associated with its authorizing action
- Minimize disruption to ongoing development during the transition
- Create clear mappings between documentation and code
- Eliminate redundant or deprecated code

## Background

### Problem Statement

The UltraAI codebase currently contains numerous directories with unclear organization principles. Multiple directories serve similar functions, making it difficult to understand which code implements which functionality. Without a coordinated reorganization, development efforts may be fragmented and inefficient.

### Current State

- Code is scattered across multiple directories
- Unclear relationships between code directories and actions
- Inconsistent directory structures and naming conventions
- Redundant code in different locations
- Legacy code mixed with active development

### Desired Future State

- Clear mapping of code to actions
- Consistent directory structure for all components
- Standard locations for each type of code
- Clean separation between production and development code
- Explicit dependencies between components

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Codebase Inventory and Mapping (Week 1, Days 1-3)

## Handling Unclassified Content

During migration, some files and directories may not have a clear place in the new structure. We've created an `UNCLASSIFIED` directory within this action's directory to temporarily store such content.

### Unclassified Content Process

1. **Directory Structure**

   ```
   Actions/CODEBASE_REORGANIZATION/UNCLASSIFIED/
   ├── original_directory_name1/
   │   └── [Original files]
   ├── original_directory_name2/
   │   └── [Original files]
   └── ...
   ```

2. **Classification Requirements**
   - Each unclassified directory should include analysis details in this plan
   - Document content overview, known usage, and dependencies
   - Propose resolution: appropriate action, target location, needed refactoring
   - Record stakeholder input and final decisions

3. **Resolution Process**
   - Identification: Move unclear content to UNCLASSIFIED
   - Analysis: Determine purpose and relationships
   - Consultation: Get stakeholder input
   - Decision: Determine proper disposition
   - Implementation: Move to final location or archive

### Unclassified Content Status

| Original Location | Status | Analysis | Target Location | Decision |
|-------------------|--------|----------|-----------------|----------|
| `/monitoring/` | In Analysis | The monitoring directory has dependencies on src/core modules that need clarification. Linter errors detected after updating import paths. | Provisional: `src/monitoring/` | Pending further analysis |

**Monitoring Analysis Details**:

- **Key Issues**:
  - Multiple locations exist for imported modules (ultra_config.py and ultra_base.py)
  - Unknown attributes accessed (config.performance)
  - Possible MPS backend compatibility issues in torch integration
- **Required Actions**:
  - Determine canonical location of dependency modules
  - Verify attribute structure of UltraConfig
  - Test compatibility with current torch version
- **Assigned To**: Architecture Team

### Benchmarks Directory Migration

**Original Path**: `/benchmarks/`
**Target Path**: `/tests/performance/`
**Assigned Action**: TESTING_STRATEGY

#### Content Analysis

The benchmarks directory contains:

- `README.md`: Describes the benchmarking tools and structure
- `load_testing/`: Empty directory for system load testing configurations
- `models/`: Empty directory for LLM model comparison benchmarks
- `performance/`: Empty directory for application performance benchmarks

Interestingly, while the README.md describes various benchmark scripts and functionality, the directories themselves are empty. This suggests the benchmarking system is either still in planning stages or the actual implementation exists elsewhere.

#### Dependencies

- No immediate code dependencies identified as the directories are empty
- The README.md references running scripts like `run_model_benchmark.py`, `measure_response_times.py`, and `simulate_users.py`, but these don't exist in the checked directories
- References data being saved to `data/results/`, which should be considered in the migration

#### Migration Plan

1. Create the target directory structure:

   ```
   tests/performance/
   ├── benchmarks/
   │   ├── load_testing/
   │   ├── models/
   │   └── performance/
   ```

2. Copy files to the new location while preserving structure
3. Update the README.md to reflect the new paths
4. Ensure any potential references to the benchmarks directory in other code are updated

#### Implementation Notes

This directory is mostly a placeholder structure with documentation but no actual code. This makes it a very low-risk migration, with the main task being to properly update path references in the README.md.

The empty state of the subdirectories suggests this is a planned feature not yet implemented, or the implementation exists elsewhere and the directories serve as mount points or documentation placeholders.

#### Implementation Status

- [x] Create target directories
- [x] Migrate files
- [x] Update path references in README.md
- [x] Update documentation references (Updated the verify_structure.sh script to reference new paths)
- [ ] Remove original directory

**Progress Note**: The benchmarks directory structure has been successfully migrated to tests/performance/benchmarks. The README.md has been updated with the new paths, and the verify_structure.sh script has been modified to check for files in the new location. Since this was largely a placeholder structure with minimal actual code, the migration was very straightforward. The only remaining step is to remove the original directory once we're confident in the migration.

### Mock API Directory Migration

**Original Path**: `/mock-api/`
**Target Path**: `/src/api/mocks/`
**Assigned Action**: API_DEVELOPMENT

#### Content Analysis

The mock-api directory contains:

- `server.js`: Express server implementation with mock API endpoints
- `package.json` and `package-lock.json`: Node.js dependencies
- `uploads/`: Directory for storing uploaded files during testing

#### Dependencies

- Node.js dependencies: express, cors, multer
- No direct dependencies on other parts of the codebase

#### Migration Plan

1. Create the target directory structure:

   ```
   src/api/mocks/
   └── uploads/
   ```

2. Copy files to the new location
3. Update the file paths in the server.js file if needed
4. Create a README.md with information about the mock API
5. Test the mock server from the new location
6. Update documentation references

#### Implementation Notes

The mock-api is a self-contained Express server with minimal external dependencies, making it a good candidate for migration. The main considerations were:

- Ensuring the uploads directory gets created in the new location
- Verifying the server still functions with the updated paths
- Providing documentation in the form of a README

#### Implementation Status

- [x] Create target directories
- [x] Migrate files
- [x] Update paths in server.js (No path changes needed; paths are relative to __dirname)
- [x] Create README.md
- [x] Test functionality (Server starts and endpoints work correctly)
- [x] Create parent directory README.md
- [ ] Remove original directory

**Progress Note**: The mock-api has been successfully migrated to src/api/mocks. All functionality remains intact, with the server operating as it did before. A comprehensive README.md file was created both for the mocks directory and the parent api directory to provide context and usage instructions.

### Public API Directory Migration

**Original Path**: `/public_api/`
**Target Path**: `/src/api/public/`
**Assigned Action**: API_DEVELOPMENT

#### Content Analysis

The public_api directory contains:

- `README.md`: Documentation about the public API
- `docs/`: Empty directory for API documentation
- `spec/`: Empty directory for OpenAPI specifications
- `sdks/`: Empty directory for client libraries

#### Dependencies

- No direct dependencies as the directories are largely placeholder structures

#### Migration Plan

1. Create the target directory structure:

   ```
   src/api/public/
   ├── docs/
   ├── spec/
   └── sdks/
   ```

2. Copy README.md to the new location
3. Update any path references in the README
4. Document the directory structure in the parent api README

#### Implementation Notes

The public_api directory is primarily documentation and placeholder directories, making it a straightforward migration. Like the benchmarks directory, this is more of a structural migration than a functional one.

#### Implementation Status

- [x] Create target directories
- [x] Migrate README.md
- [x] Update README.md with migration note
- [x] Create parent directory README.md
- [ ] Remove original directory

**Progress Note**: The public_api directory has been successfully migrated to src/api/public. The directory structure has been recreated and the README.md updated with a migration note. A parent directory README.md was created to provide context for the API-related code organization.

## Target Directory Structure

The reorganized codebase will follow this structure:

```
