- [x] Created comprehensive test for available models endpoint (test_available_models_endpoint.py)
- [x] Created comprehensive test for LLM request endpoint (test_llm_request_endpoint.py)
- [x] Created comprehensive test for health endpoint (test_health_endpoint.py)
- [x] Updated conftest.py with shared fixtures and mock data
- [x] Created pytest.ini configuration
- [x] Created test runner script (run_tests.sh)
- [x] Created comprehensive JWT utility tests (test_jwt_utils.py)
- [x] Created authentication edge case tests (test_auth_edge_cases.py)

## Progress Summary

### Completed
- Created comprehensive tests for critical API endpoints (health, analyze, available-models, llm-request)
- Implemented comprehensive tests for JWT utilities and authentication edge cases
- Created complete end-to-end tests for the authentication flow
- Created comprehensive tests for rate limiting service and middleware
- Updated testing infrastructure with shared fixtures and test configurations
- Created a test runner script to execute tests in the proper order

### In Progress
- End-to-end testing for document analysis flow
- CI pipeline integration

### Next Steps
1. Implement end-to-end tests for the document analysis flow
2. Set up basic CI pipeline integration
