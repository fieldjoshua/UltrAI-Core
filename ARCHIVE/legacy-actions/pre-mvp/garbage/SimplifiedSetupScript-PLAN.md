# SimplifiedSetupScript Action Plan

## Status

- **Current Status:** PendingApproval
- **Progress:** 0%
- **Last Updated:** 2025-05-02

## Objective

Create a streamlined, user-friendly setup script that automates the installation of all required dependencies for the Ultra project, significantly reducing the time and effort needed to set up a development environment.

## Background

The Ultra project has multiple dependencies including Python packages, database requirements, and external services. Currently, developers need to manually install and configure these dependencies following scattered documentation, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. A simplified setup script would standardize this process, reduce onboarding time, and ensure consistent development environments.

## Steps

1. **Audit Current Setup Requirements**

   - [ ] Review existing documentation and setup instructions
   - [ ] Identify all required dependencies (packages, services, tools)
   - [ ] Document current installation steps and pain points
   - [ ] Determine platform-specific requirements (Linux, macOS, Windows)

2. **Design Script Architecture**

   - [ ] Choose appropriate scripting language(s) for cross-platform support
   - [ ] Define modularity structure for maintainability
   - [ ] Plan error handling and recovery mechanisms
   - [ ] Design user interaction and progress reporting

3. **Implement Core Setup Logic**

   - [ ] Create base script structure with platform detection
   - [ ] Implement virtual environment creation
   - [ ] Add dependency installation from requirements.txt
   - [ ] Develop configuration file generation

4. **Add Database Setup**

   - [ ] Implement database detection and installation if needed
   - [ ] Add schema initialization and migration execution
   - [ ] Create test data population option
   - [ ] Implement database connection verification

5. **Add Service Configuration**

   - [ ] Implement Redis setup and configuration
   - [ ] Add API key configuration assistance
   - [ ] Develop service dependency checks
   - [ ] Create service startup verification

6. **Implement Verification and Testing**

   - [ ] Add system verification to confirm successful setup
   - [ ] Create test mode to validate environment
   - [ ] Implement dependency version compatibility checks
   - [ ] Add diagnostic reporting for troubleshooting

7. **Documentation and User Experience**

   - [ ] Create detailed usage instructions
   - [ ] Add inline help and documentation
   - [ ] Implement colorful, informative console output
   - [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common issues

8. **Testing**
   - [ ] Test script on different operating systems
   - [ ] Verify idempotent operation (can be run multiple times safely)
   - [ ] Test recovery from common failure scenarios
   - [ ] Validate with different starting environments

## Success Criteria

- A single command can set up a complete development environment
- Script works on all supported platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- All dependencies are correctly installed and configured
- Script provides clear, actionable feedback during the setup process
- Failed installations are handled gracefully with helpful error messages
- Setup time is significantly reduced compared to manual installation
- Script is maintainable and easily updated as dependencies change

## Technical Requirements

- Script must be executable with minimal prerequisites (Python or shell)
- Must handle differences between operating systems
- Should validate system requirements before attempting installation
- Must not overwrite existing configurations without confirmation
- Should support both interactive and non-interactive (CI/CD) modes
- Documentation must be clear and comprehensive

## Dependencies

- None

## Timeline

- Start: TBD (After approval)
- Target Completion: TBD + 6 days
- Estimated Duration: 6 days

## Notes

This action will significantly improve the developer onboarding experience and ensure consistent development environments. The script should be designed to be maintainable as the project evolves, with a modular structure that allows easy updates when dependencies change.
