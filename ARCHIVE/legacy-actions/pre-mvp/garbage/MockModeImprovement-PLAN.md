# MockModeImprovement Action Plan

## Status

- **Current Status:** PendingApproval
- **Progress:** 0%
- **Last Updated:** 2025-05-02

## Objective

Enhance the default mock mode in Ultra with more realistic data and behavior to improve development experience, enable effective offline development, and facilitate reliable testing without depending on external services.

## Background

The Ultra system currently has a basic mock mode that allows development without connecting to real LLM APIs and other external services. However, the current implementation lacks realism in data and behavior, limiting its usefulness for development and testing. An improved mock mode would better simulate real-world usage patterns, enable more accurate testing, and improve the development experience.

## Steps

1. **Audit Current Mock Implementation**

   - [ ] Review existing mock services and data
   - [ ] Identify gaps in mock coverage
   - [ ] Document current mock mode activation process
   - [ ] Assess realism of existing mock responses

2. **Design Enhanced Mock Architecture**

   - [ ] Define consistent interface for all mock services
   - [ ] Design configurable fidelity levels (simple/realistic)
   - [ ] Plan mock data storage and retrieval
   - [ ] Create mock service discovery mechanism

3. **Collect and Generate Realistic Sample Data**

   - [ ] Gather anonymized real-world LLM responses
   - [ ] Create realistic test prompts and queries
   - [ ] Generate varied response patterns for different models
   - [ ] Develop domain-specific test scenarios

4. **Implement Enhanced LLM API Mocks**

   - [ ] Create realistic OpenAI API simulation
   - [ ] Implement Anthropic API mock with Claude-like responses
   - [ ] Develop Google Gemini API mock
   - [ ] Add response delay simulation for realism

5. **Improve Database and Cache Mocking**

   - [ ] Implement in-memory database with realistic schemas
   - [ ] Create mock Redis cache with appropriate behaviors
   - [ ] Add simulated persistence between sessions
   - [ ] Implement configurable failure scenarios

6. **Develop Mock Service Controls**

   - [ ] Create admin panel for mock configuration
   - [ ] Implement latency and error injection controls
   - [ ] Add mock data management interface
   - [ ] Develop logging for mock service interactions

7. **Build Testing Utilities**

   - [ ] Create deterministic test mode with fixed responses
   - [ ] Implement response recording for test creation
   - [ ] Develop assertion helpers for mock verification
   - [ ] Add scenario playback capabilities

8. **Documentation and Integration**
   - [ ] Create comprehensive mock mode documentation
   - [ ] Update development guides with mock usage examples
   - [ ] Document mock activation and configuration
   - [ ] Add examples for extending mock functionality

## Success Criteria

- Developers can work effectively without internet connectivity
- Mock responses closely resemble real LLM outputs
- All external dependencies have realistic mock implementations
- Mock mode can be easily enabled/disabled
- Test suite runs successfully with mock services
- Mock services support common failure scenarios
- Documentation comprehensively covers mock usage and configuration

## Technical Requirements

- Mock services must implement the same interfaces as real services
- Performance impact of mock mode should be minimal
- Configuration should be persistent and easily modified
- Mock implementation should be maintainable as real services evolve
- Clear indication when system is running in mock mode

## Dependencies

- None

## Timeline

- Start: TBD (After approval)
- Target Completion: TBD + 8 days
- Estimated Duration: 8 days

## Notes

This action will significantly improve the development and testing experience by providing realistic simulations of external services. The focus is on creating mock implementations that closely mimic real service behavior while remaining configurable to support different testing scenarios. The improved mock mode will be particularly valuable for offline development, CI/CD pipelines, and testing edge cases that are difficult to reproduce with real services.
