3. Choose analysis patterns/methods
4. View results with appropriate formatting
5. Experience reliable system performance
6. Understand how to use the system

#### 6. Simple Authentication System (New)

- **Dependencies:** APIIntegration
- **Purpose:** Provide basic user authentication
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Login/logout functionality
  - API key protection
  - Session management
  - User-specific configurations

### Phase 3: Reliability & Quality Assurance (High Priority)

#### 7. MVPTestCoverage (In Progress)

- **Dependencies:** All core functionality
- **Purpose:** Ensure critical flows work reliably
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Tests for critical API endpoints
  - LLM integration tests with mocks
  - End-to-end flow tests
  - Error handling tests

#### 8. Error Handling Improvement (New)

- **Dependencies:** IterativeOrchestratorBuild, APIIntegration
- **Purpose:** Provide robust error handling across the system
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Meaningful user-facing error messages
  - Handling for LLM API failures/timeouts
  - Recovery procedures
  - Error logging and tracking

#### 9. Fallback Mechanisms (New)

- **Dependencies:** IterativeOrchestratorBuild
- **Purpose:** Ensure the system can continue functioning when components fail
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - LLM provider failover
  - Caching for resilience
  - Degraded mode operation
  - Queue system for retries

### Phase 4: Deployment & Operations (Medium-High Priority)

#### 10. Deployment Pipeline (New)

- **Dependencies:** All core functionality
- **Purpose:** Create streamlined deployment process
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Containerization finalization
  - Environment configuration
  - Release process documentation
  - Deployment verification testing

#### 11. Monitoring and Logging (New)

- **Dependencies:** Core functionality
- **Purpose:** Enable troubleshooting in production
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Request/response logging
  - Error tracking
  - Performance metrics
  - Resource usage monitoring

### Phase 5: Documentation & Finalization (Medium Priority)

#### 12. MVP Documentation (New)

- **Dependencies:** All core functionality
- **Purpose:** Provide essential user and developer documentation
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Quick start guide
  - API documentation
  - Analysis pattern explanations
  - Troubleshooting guide

#### 13. DataPipelineRefactor (In Progress)

- **Dependencies:** Orchestrator
- **Purpose:** Improve data flow through the system
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Optimized data processing
  - Efficient transformations
  - Improved pipeline reliability

## Integration Testing Requirements

In addition to the MVPTestCoverage action, specific integration testing is needed to verify the complete system works as expected:

1. **End-to-end User Flow Testing**

   - Complete user journeys from login to results
   - Cross-component interactions
   - Error recovery scenarios

2. **Performance Testing Under Load**

   - Response times with multiple concurrent users
   - System behavior at capacity limits
   - Resource utilization patterns

3. **Security Testing**
   - Authentication bypass attempts
   - Input validation checks
   - API security verification

## MVP Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful when:

1. Users can successfully complete the core user journey:

   - Log in to the system
   - Submit prompts with selected LLMs and analysis patterns
   - Receive meaningful, well-formatted results
   - Navigate the interface intuitively

2. The system demonstrates reliability:

   - Handles errors gracefully
   - Recovers from component failures
   - Maintains performance under expected load

3. Security requirements are satisfied:

   - User data is protected
   - API keys are secure
   - Input validation prevents injection attacks

4. Documentation enables users to understand the system

## Post-MVP Enhancements

The following in-progress actions should be considered for post-MVP enhancement:

1. **EnhancedUX** - Improved user experience beyond basic functionality
2. **UIConsolidation** - Consistent UI styling and behavior
3. **APIConsolidation** - Further API refinement and optimization
4. **ProductVisionDocument** - Strategic planning for product evolution
5. **ProjectReorganization** - Codebase improvements for maintainability
