10. **MVPDeploymentPipeline (10 of 16)** - Streamlined deployment

    - Finalizes Docker containerization
    - Creates environment configuration management
    - Establishes deployment verification
    - Provides rollback capabilities

11. **MonitoringAndLogging (11 of 16)** - Production observability
    - Implements structured logging
    - Adds performance metrics collection
    - Creates health check endpoints
    - Sets up basic alerting

### Medium Priority

12. **MVPDocumentation (12 of 16)** - Essential documentation

    - Creates user and developer documentation
    - Documents API endpoints
    - Provides troubleshooting guides
    - Explains system architecture

13. **MVPIntegrationTesting (13 of 16)** - Cross-component testing
    - Validates end-to-end user flows
    - Tests cross-component interactions
    - Verifies system performance under load
    - Validates error scenarios

### Lower Priority (Can Defer Post-MVP)

14. **EnhancedUX (14 of 16)** - User experience improvements

    - Enhances the basic UI with improved interactions
    - Adds additional user feedback mechanisms
    - Implements visual enhancements

15. **UIConsolidation (15 of 16)** - UI consistency

    - Standardizes UI components and behavior
    - Implements consistent styling
    - Improves visual coherence

16. **ImprovementsRedux (16 of 16)** - Additional enhancements
    - Further system optimizations
    - Performance improvements
    - Additional features beyond MVP requirements

## Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful when:

1. Users can successfully complete the core user journey:

   - Log in to the system
   - Submit prompts with selected LLMs and analysis patterns
   - Receive meaningful, well-formatted results
   - Navigate the interface intuitively

2. The system demonstrates reliability:

   - Handles errors gracefully
   - Recovers from component failures
   - Maintains performance under expected load

3. Security requirements are satisfied:

   - User data is protected
   - API keys are secure
   - Input validation prevents injection attacks

4. Documentation enables users to understand the system

## Next Steps

1. Begin immediate implementation of IterativeOrchestratorBuild
2. Continue work on APIIntegration and OrchestratorRefactor
3. Start MVPSecurityImplementation
4. Create detailed implementation plans for each priority action
5. Establish weekly progress checkpoints to monitor advancement
