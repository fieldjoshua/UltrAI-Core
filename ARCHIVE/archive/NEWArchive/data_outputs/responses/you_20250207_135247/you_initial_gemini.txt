**Title:** AI Orchestration System for Collaborative Analysis and Synthesis

**Inventors:**
* [Inventor 1 Name]
* [Inventor 2 Name]

**Abstract**

The present invention provides an AI orchestration system that enables multiple AI models to collaboratively analyze and synthesize information. The system can be used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of AI applications in various domains, such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing.

**Background**

AI models are increasingly used to perform complex tasks, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. However, individual AI models often have limitations, such as bias, limited data availability, and difficulty in handling complex and multi-faceted problems.

**Summary of the Invention**

The present invention addresses these limitations by providing an AI orchestration system that enables multiple AI models to collaborate and leverage their respective strengths. The system includes the following components:

* **Model Interface:** A standardized interface that allows different AI models to communicate and exchange information.
* **Orchestration Engine:** A central component that manages the execution of AI models and orchestrates their collaboration.
* **Collaborative Analysis Module:** A module that aggregates the outputs of individual AI models and fuses them to generate a more comprehensive and accurate analysis.
* **Synthesizer:** A module that combines the results of the collaborative analysis to generate a synthesized report or conclusion.

**Detailed Description**

The AI orchestration system operates as follows:

1. **Model Selection:** The user specifies the AI models to be orchestrated based on the task at hand.
2. **Model Interfacing:** The system establishes communication channels between the selected AI models using the model interface.
3. **Model Execution:** The orchestration engine triggers the execution of the AI models on the input data.
4. **Collaborative Analysis:** The collaborative analysis module aggregates the outputs of the individual AI models and fuses them using a predefined algorithm.
5. **Synthesis:** The synthesizer combines the results of the collaborative analysis to generate a synthesized report or conclusion.

**Advantages of the Invention**

The present invention offers several advantages over existing AI systems:

* **Improved Accuracy:** Collaborative analysis allows for the cross-validation of results and the identification of errors.
* **Enhanced Efficiency:** By parallelizing the execution of AI models, the system can significantly reduce processing times.
* **Increased Versatility:** The orchestration system can accommodate a wide range of AI models, enabling the customization of solutions for specific tasks.
* **Reduced Bias:** The collaboration of diverse AI models helps mitigate bias and improve the fairness of the analysis.
