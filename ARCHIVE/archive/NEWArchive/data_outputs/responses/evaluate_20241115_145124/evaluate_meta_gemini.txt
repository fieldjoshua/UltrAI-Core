  "gemini": "## Method and System for Automated Essay Scoring\n\n**Abstract**\n\nThe present invention relates to a novel method and system for automated essay scoring. This invention leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) to provide an accurate, efficient, and scalable solution for assessing written essays. By automating the scoring process, educators and institutions can save time, reduce bias, and enhance the overall fairness and consistency of essay evaluation.\n\n**Background**\n\nTraditionally, essay scoring has been a manual process, relying on human graders to evaluate each essay subjectively. This approach is not only time-consuming but also prone to inconsistencies and bias. Automated essay scoring systems have emerged as a potential solution, but many existing systems lack the accuracy and reliability required for practical use.\n\n**Detailed Description**\n\nThe proposed method utilizes advanced AI and NLP techniques to overcome the limitations of previous automated essay scoring systems. It incorporates the following key components:\n\n* **Natural Language Understanding**: The system employs NLP models to extract meaning from the essay text, analyzing grammar, syntax, and semantics.\n* **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Supervised machine learning algorithms are trained on a large dataset of human-scored essays to learn the characteristics of high-quality writing.\n* **Scoring Engine**: The trained models are used to generate automated essay scores, providing detailed feedback on various aspects of writing, such as content, structure, and language use.\n\n**Advantages**\n\nThis automated essay scoring system offers several advantages:\n\n* **Accuracy and Reliability**: The system is trained on a vast dataset, ensuring accurate and consistent scoring across different essays.\n* **Efficiency and Scalability**: Automation significantly reduces the time and effort required for essay scoring, enabling the evaluation of large volumes of essays efficiently.\n* **Reduced Bias**: By eliminating human subjectivity, the system minimizes bias and ensures fair and impartial scoring.\n* **Detailed Feedback**: The system provides comprehensive feedback on various aspects of writing, helping students identify areas for improvement.\n\n**Code:**\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n\ndef score_essay(essay_text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Score an essay using the automated essay scoring system.\n\n    Parameters:\n        essay_text (str): The text of the essay to be scored.\n\n    Returns:\n
