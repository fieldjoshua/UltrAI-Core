## Anomaly Detection Method for Time Series Data

**Abstract**

The present invention is directed to a method for detecting anomalies in time series data. The method is based on the statistical concept of the Box Plot Interquartile Range (IQR), which provides a robust measure of spread in the data. By identifying outliers that fall outside a predefined IQR threshold, the method can effectively detect anomalous patterns or events in the time series.

**Background**

Time series data, which represents a sequence of observations collected over time, often contains anomalies or outliers that can deviate significantly from the expected distribution. These anomalies can indicate unusual events, errors, or system malfunctions. Detecting anomalies in time series data is crucial for various applications, such as fault detection in manufacturing processes, fraud detection in financial transactions, and early detection of health issues.

**Detailed Description**

The proposed method utilizes the concept of the Box Plot IQR to identify anomalies in time series data. The IQR is a measure of the spread of data that is less sensitive to outliers than the standard deviation. It is calculated as the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles of the data.

Once the IQR is calculated, the method identifies anomalies as data points that fall outside a predefined IQR threshold. The threshold can be set to a multiple of the IQR, typically 1.5 or 3. Data points beyond this threshold are considered to be significantly different from the rest of the data and are flagged as anomalies.

The following steps summarize the method:

1. Calculate the median, 75th percentile, and 25th percentile of the time series data.
2. Compute the IQR as the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles.
3. Define an IQR threshold as a multiple of the IQR (e.g., 1.5 or 3).
4. Identify anomalies as data points that fall outside the IQR threshold.

**Advantages**

The proposed method offers several advantages over existing anomaly detection techniques:

* **Robustness:** It utilizes the IQR, which is less susceptible to outliers compared to the standard deviation.
* **Simplicity:** The method is straightforward to implement and requires only basic statistical calculations.
* **Tunable:** The IQR threshold can be adjusted to balance sensitivity and specificity in anomaly detection.
