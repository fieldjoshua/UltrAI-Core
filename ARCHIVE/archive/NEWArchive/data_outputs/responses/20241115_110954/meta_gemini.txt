Following extensive development, user research, and team expansion, we are poised to deliver a groundbreaking MVP that addresses critical pain points in the criminal defense process.

**Problem and Market Opportunity**

Criminal defense attorneys face significant challenges in managing discovery, a labor-intensive and time-consuming task. GIDEON solves this problem by automating discovery, saving attorneys countless hours and enabling them to focus on higher-value activities. The criminal defense market presents a vast opportunity, with attorneys facing increasing pressure to provide effective representation in a complex legal landscape.

**Solution and Key Features**

The GIDEON MVP centers on intelligent discovery organization. It automatically processes discovery materials, extracts relevant facts based on charges, and organizes them into an efficient, proprietary M-DREN system. This streamlines the discovery process, providing attorneys with a clear and organized view of the evidence.

To enhance the MVP, we will focus on several key areas:
