As GIDEON enters its launch phase, our pricing strategy is meticulously tailored to drive market penetration while fostering widespread adoption within the criminal defense ecosystem. We recognize that diverse stakeholders have varying financial capabilities, and our tiered monthly subscription model accommodates this reality.

Our subscription rates are competitively positioned within the legal tech landscape, ranging from $50 to $500 per month. This flexible pricing structure empowers individual attorneys and small firms to access GIDEON's transformative technology at a cost that aligns with their resources.

Furthermore, we acknowledge the unique challenges faced by public defenders. To ensure equity and accessibility, we offer reduced rates to public defender organizations. By empowering these essential stakeholders, we aim to enhance the quality of criminal defense for the most vulnerable members of our society.

Our data-sharing partnerships will also benefit from discounted pricing. This collaborative approach fosters a mutually beneficial ecosystem where information flows freely, enabling us to collectively elevate the criminal defense landscape.

Our pricing strategy is a testament to GIDEON's commitment to democratizing access to justice. By offering flexible and accessible options, we empower criminal defense professionals with the tools they need to deliver exceptional outcomes for their clients, regardless of their financial constraints.
