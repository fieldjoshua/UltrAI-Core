## Technical Field
The present invention relates to artificial intelligence systems and, more particularly, to a system and method for orchestrating multiple AI models to generate highly refined and comprehensive responses to user prompts.

## Background
With the rapid advancement of AI technology, advanced AI language models such as LLAMA, ChatGPT, and Gemini have emerged, each with its unique strengths and capabilities. However, utilizing these models independently often falls short of realizing their full potential.

## Summary of the Invention
The present invention addresses the limitations of existing AI systems by providing a novel orchestration system that seamlessly integrates multiple AI models to create enhanced responses that leverage the collective strengths of each model.

## Detailed Description
### System Overview
The orchestration system comprises an API for interfacing with various AI models, a workflow engine that manages the execution of models, and a post-processing module that refines and synthesizes the generated responses.

### Model Orchestration
The workflow engine orchestrates the execution of AI models in a predefined sequence. For each prompt, the system assigns tasks to the models and manages rate limiting to prevent API saturation.

### Response Refinement
To enhance the quality of responses, the system employs a meta-learning approach. It analyzes the initial responses from each model and generates meta-prompts that guide the models to provide more refined and comprehensive responses.

### Hyper-Level Synthesis
The system incorporates a unique hyper-level synthesis engine that analyzes the meta-responses and identifies patterns and insights that are not readily apparent from the individual responses. This engine produces a final, highly refined hyper-response that encapsulates the collective knowledge of all the models.

### Claims
1. An AI orchestration system comprising:
   - an API for interfacing with multiple AI models;
   - a workflow engine for managing the execution of models;
   - a post-processing module for refining and synthesizing generated responses;
   - wherein the system orchestrates the execution of models in a predefined sequence.

2. The system of claim 1, wherein the post-processing module employs a meta-learning approach to analyze and refine initial responses.

3. The system of claim 1, wherein the system incorporates a hyper-level synthesis engine for analyzing meta-responses and generating a final refined response.

## Code Implementation
The code for the orchestration system is provided in the accompanying file.
