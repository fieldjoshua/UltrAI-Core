**Code:**

```
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load the image
image = cv2.imread('image.jpg')

# Convert the image to HSV color space
hsv = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)

# Create a mask for the blue color
blue_mask = cv2.inRange(hsv, (110, 100, 100), (130, 255, 255))

# Create a mask for the red color
red_mask = cv2.inRange(hsv, (0, 100, 100), (10, 255, 255))

# Combine the blue and red masks to get a mask for the colors we want to detect
mask = cv2.bitwise_or(blue_mask, red_mask)

# Apply the mask to the image to get the detected objects
detected_objects = cv2.bitwise_and(image, image, mask=mask)

# Display the detected objects
cv2.imshow('Detected Objects', detected_objects)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

**Description of functionality:**

This code implements a simple color detection algorithm in Python using OpenCV. It can be used to detect and isolate specific colors within an image. The functionality of the code is as follows:

1. It reads an image from a file.
2. Converts the image from BGR to HSV color space. HSV is a more intuitive color space for detecting specific colors because it separates hue, saturation, and value.
3. Creates a mask for the blue color using the inRange function. The mask is a binary image where the pixels corresponding to the specified color range are set to 255, and all other pixels are set to 0.
4. Similarly, creates a mask for the red color.
5. Combines the blue and red masks using bitwise OR operation to create a mask for the colors we want to detect.
6. Applies the mask to the original image using bitwise AND operation to get the detected objects.
7. Displays the detected objects in a window.
8. Waits for a key to be pressed before closing the window.
