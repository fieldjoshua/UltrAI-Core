I need to learn about UX/UI but I dont need the basics -- im not implementing. I need broad vision on what the future of the technology can/will be. I am particularly interested in up and coming talent/centers, the use and specialization of the data, AI Uses combination with AI, and relevant movements and style characteristics. Can you establish any needed bedrook concepts as you see fit.
