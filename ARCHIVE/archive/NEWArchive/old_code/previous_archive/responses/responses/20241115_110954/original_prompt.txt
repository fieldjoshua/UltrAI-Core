GIDEON stands at a pivotal moment, ready to transform from concept to reality. After months of careful development and validation, we've created a solution that promises to revolutionize criminal defense practice. With our new CTO, Brig, joining the team, we're poised to refine our technical roadmap and begin implementation.

The foundation is already in place. Early on, I conducted pain point interviews with public defenders and private criminal attorneys to determine where GIDEON could be the most useful in the space. We have produced promising MVP prototype outputs, created initial UX/UI mockups, and are working to identify early adopters who recognize our platform's transformative potential and can help us test and iterate the MVP.

Our immediate focus is developing a robust MVP centered on GIDEON's core feature: intelligent discovery organization. Imagine a criminal defense attorney receiving a massive PDF file containing all the state's evidence against their client. Rather than spending hours manually reviewing and organizing this information, GIDEON will automatically process the discovery, extract relevant facts based on the charges filed, and classify them into our innovative M-DREN (Modular-Dynamic Relevant Evidence Nuggets) system. The MVP alone will provide immediate value to any criminal defense practice.

Before we can release our MVP, however, we need to address several critical areas. We must:

Develop a streamlined, intuitive MVP user interface that makes GIDEON accessible to all attorneys, regardless of their technical expertise.

Create robust security and privacy protocols to protect sensitive client data and maintain attorney-client privilege.

Solve the practical challenges of processing diverse data formats, including handwritten notes.

Perfect our GIDEON Criminal Law Lens, which combines natural language processing with retrieval-augmented generation to ensure accurate, bias-free analysis focused on criminal law specifics.

We will expand GIDEON's capabilities once the MVP is tested and refined. We're particularly excited about GIDEONTake, our client intake system, which we believe could serve as a standalone product and an entry point for users to experience the broader GIDEON ecosystem.

On the business front, we're actively building relationships within the criminal defense community. From public defender agencies to bar associations, state defender organizations, and law schools, we're creating a network of partners who share our vision for transforming criminal defense practice through technology.

With funding, GIDEON will be ready to realize this vision, empowering criminal defense attorneys to provide better representation and achieve better outcomes for their clients.
