**Technical Field**

The present invention relates to artificial intelligence (AI) systems and, more particularly, to a system and method for orchestrating multiple AI models to provide comprehensive and nuanced analyses of user-provided prompts.

**Background**

The use of AI models has become increasingly prevalent in a variety of applications, including natural language processing, image recognition, and predictive analytics. However, individual AI models often have limitations in terms of their scope of knowledge, reasoning abilities, and ability to incorporate multiple perspectives.

**Summary of the Invention**

The present invention provides a system and method for overcoming the limitations of individual AI models by orchestrating multiple models to work together synergistically. The system comprises a plurality of AI models, each with its own unique strengths and weaknesses, and a novel workflow that enables the models to collaboratively analyze and refine user-provided prompts.

**Detailed Description**

The system includes a user interface that allows users to input a prompt. The prompt can be any question, request, or other form of input that the user wishes to have analyzed. The system then selects a set of AI models to analyze the prompt. The selection of models is based on a variety of factors, including the nature of the prompt, the desired level of analysis, and the availability of the models.

Once the models have been selected, they are orchestrated to work together in a multi-stage process. In the first stage, each model independently analyzes the prompt and generates an initial response. These initial responses are then analyzed by a meta-model, which identifies similarities and differences between the responses and generates a consolidated meta-response.

In the next stage, the meta-response is used to generate an ultra-response. The ultra-response is a more comprehensive and nuanced analysis that incorporates the insights from the initial responses and the meta-response. Finally, the ultra-response is analyzed by a hyper-model, which generates a hyper-response that provides a high-level synthesis of the previous analyses and identifies emergent patterns and insights.

The output of the system is a set of responses that provide a comprehensive and nuanced analysis of the user-provided prompt. The responses can be used to support decision-making, problem-solving, and creative thinking.
