**Technical Field**

The present invention relates to the field of artificial intelligence and natural language processing. More specifically, it pertains to an advanced orchestration system for integrating and synthesizing responses from multiple artificial intelligence (AI) models to derive enhanced, synthesized insights from their collective intelligence.

**Background**

The integration of multiple AI models presents a significant challenge in the field of AI due to the varying outputs, rate limits, and processing capabilities of each model. Achieving a cohesive synthesis of information that leverages the strengths of each model remains a technical challenge. Current solutions typically rely on singular model outputs or manual integration processes, which neither scales nor fully utilizes the potential collective intelligence achievable through multi-model integration.

**Summary of the Invention**

The disclosed invention, named TriLLMOrchestrator, provides a novel system and method for the integration of multiple AI models to produce a synthesized, multi-layered analysis of a given prompt. This system utilizes a unique workflow to process the prompt through successive layers of analysis by different AI engines, including Llama, ChatGPT, and Gemini, each chosen for its specific strengths. The orchestration system ensures a cohesive operation amongst these models, managing rate limits, and optimizing for the best use of each model's capabilities, leading to a refined, high-quality output that surpasses what any single AI model could produce on its own.

**Detailed Description**

The TriLLMOrchestrator system initializes by setting up the necessary configurations for API keys, prompt templates, rate limits, and the specified output format. It then proceeds through a multi-stage process:

1. **Initial Response Generation:** The system sends the user's prompt to each AI model (Llama, ChatGPT, and Gemini) concurrently, abiding by each model's rate limits. The initial responses are then gathered.

2. **Meta Response Generation:** The system synthesizes the initial responses into a new prompt, which is then fed back to each AI model to derive a 'meta' analysis.

3. **Ultra Response Generation:** Depending on the specified ultra engine (Llama, ChatGPT, or Gemini), the system synthesizes the meta responses into a final prompt to generate an 'ultra' analysis.

4. **Hyper Response Generation:** A hyper-level analysis prompt is created based on all previous responses and is used to extract deep insights and patterns from the synthesis of all previous layers, leading to a comprehensive hyper analysis.

5. **Patent Analysis Task:** The system can also analyze its own operation and output for intellectual property documentation purposes, showing a reflective capability and self-aware AI integration.

Throughout these stages, the system employs asynchronous programming and retry mechanisms with exponential backoff to efficiently manage API calls, respecting each service's rate limits while optimizing for performance and reliability. The outputs are formatted according to specifications and saved, keeping a track of metadata for auditing and analysis purposes.

**Claims**

1. A method for synthesizing responses from multiple AI models incorporating asynchronous calls, rate limit management, and a multi-stage analysis pipeline to produce enhanced insights from a given input prompt.

2. The method of claim 1, wherein the AI models include Llama for local processing, ChatGPT for conversational AI synthesis, and Gemini for high-quality AI-generated content creation.

3. A system characterized by its ability to dynamically create meta and ultra prompts based on prior responses, enabling iterative refinement of the synthesized output.

4. The system of claim 3, further characterized by a hyper analysis stage that integrates insights from all previous stages to generate a comprehensive analysis and synthesis of ideas and recommendations.

5. A digital medium encoded with computer-readable instructions for executing the method of claim 1, capable of being implemented on a computer system.

**Code Implementation**

The detailed code implementation provided supports the claims and description of the functionality of the TriLLMOrchestrator. The code illustrates the technical infrastructure required to execute this innovative orchestration system, including API client initialization, asynchronous calls, rate limit management, response formatting, and the structured workflow for processing the prompts through the AI models to achieve the desired analytical outcomes.

The primary components of the system's code include definitions of data structures for prompt templates and rate limits, initialization and configuration of AI model clients, and the orchestration logic that manages the flow of data through the system. Further, it includes error handling, retry strategies for robustness, and the file system operations necessary for saving the outputs generated at each stage of the process.

This pioneering system leverages the distinguishing capabilities of modern AI models through an ingenious orchestration mechanism, demonstrating a novel approach to achieving comprehensive and higher-order analysis from diverse AI-generated inputs.
