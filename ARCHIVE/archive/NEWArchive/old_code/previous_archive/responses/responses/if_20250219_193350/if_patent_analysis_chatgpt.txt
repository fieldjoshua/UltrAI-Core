### Title:
**System and Method for Orchestrated Multi-Model AI Response Generation and Analysis**

### Technical Field
The present invention relates generally to artificial intelligence (AI) systems. More specifically, it pertains to a method and system for orchestrating multiple AI models to generate, process, and synthesize responses based on a single prompt, utilizing unique interaction mechanisms among the models.

### Background
With the advent of diverse AI models, each with its specific strengths and capabilities, there arises a need for a system that can intelligently manage and leverage these models in concert to produce enhanced analytical outcomes. Currently, most AI-driven tasks are executed by singling out one model, which may not harness the full spectrum of analytical diversity available across different AI technologies. This limitation can result in analysis or outcomes that lack depth, fail to capture multiple perspectives, or underutilize the potential insights AI can offer.

### Summary of the Invention
The presented invention provides a novel system and method, termed TriLLMOrchestrator, designed to orchestrate the functionality of multiple AI models to produce a comprehensive, multi-faceted analysis of given prompts. This system is novel in how it integrates, manages, and synthesizes outputs from distinct AI models such as Llama, OpenAI (ChatGPT), and Gemini, guiding them through a structured workflow of initial response generation, meta-analysis, ultra analysis, and final hyper analysis.

### Detailed Description

#### Core Components:
- **TriLLMOrchestrator:** A central orchestration engine that coordinates the interaction and output synthesis from multiple AI models.
- **PromptTemplate:** Data structure for organizing various stages of prompts, facilitating customized prompts for each phase of analysis.
- **RateLimits:** Management of API call limits to efficiently utilize model resources without exceeding predefined thresholds, ensuring smooth operation.

#### Novel Features:
- **Multi-Model Workflow:** Sequentially escalating levels of analysis, where each step builds upon the previous outputs, enabling deeper insights.
- **Dynamic Rate Limiting:** Intelligent scheduling of model queries to optimize performance while adhering to service limits.
- **Hardware Optimization:** Utilizes hardware detection to maximize computation efficiency, including GPU acceleration for AI models capable of leveraging it.

#### Technical Implementation:
The system initializes by setting up API clients for Llama, OpenAI, and Gemini based on provided keys, preparing the environment for multi-model interaction. It then executes a structured workflow consisting of initial response generation from each model, meta-analysis combining all three initial responses, ultra-analysis for creating a final synthesis, and hyper-analysis to provide a high-level evaluation of all previous stages. This multi-layered approach extracts unique insights from each model at each step, culminating in a rich, deeply analyzed response.
