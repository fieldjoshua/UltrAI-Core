**Title: System and Method for Advanced Multi-AI Orchestration**

**Technical Field**
The present invention relates generally to artificial intelligence (AI) systems. More particularly, it concerns a system and method for orchestrating responses from multiple AI models to achieve an improved synthesis of information.

**Background**
The integration and management of multiple AI services to produce a cohesive output has become a significant challenge in the field of artificial intelligence. Traditional approaches involve using a single AI model to generate responses to prompts, which limits the diversity and depth of perspectives offered by different AI technologies. There exists a need for a system that efficiently orchestrates multiple AI models to leverage their unique strengths, thus providing a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the input data.

**Summary of the Invention**
The present invention addresses the aforementioned limitations by introducing a novel orchestration system, TriLLMOrchestrator, that manages the interaction between multiple AI models to generate layered and synthesized responses to prompts. This system is designed to enhance the processing methodology by leveraging the unique capabilities of each AI model involved.

**Detailed Description**
The TriLLMOrchestrator system is uniquely characterized by its method of orchestrating AI responses, integrating technologies from Google's Generative AI, OpenAI's GPT, and a local Llama API. The system utilizes hardware acceleration (e.g., MPS backends for Apple Silicon) and optimizes processing through multi-threading and rate-limit management, ensuring efficient operation across a variety of computational environments.

A key feature of the TriLLMOrchestrator is its use of data classes to store prompt templates and rate limits, allowing for dynamic modification of these parameters. The system employs asynchronous programming to manage API calls and rate-limiting, thereby maintaining high efficiency during operation.

The system's method involves several steps: initial response generation from all models, meta analysis where each model analyzes the collected initial responses, ultra synthesis where deeper insights are generated, and a final hyper synthesis that combines all previous layers of analysis into a comprehensive output. This layered approach, combined with feedback mechanisms and performance monitoring, represents a significant advancement in multi-AI integration techniques.
