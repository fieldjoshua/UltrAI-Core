**Technical Field**

The invention relates to the field of natural language processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Specifically, it pertains to systems and methods for orchestrating interaction among multiple artificial intelligence models to generate enhanced text-based responses to prompts.

**Background**

The utilization of large language models (LLMs) in generating human-like responses to text prompts has seen significant advancements. However, individual models often have limitations in terms of creativity, factual accuracy, or perspective. Typically, these models operate in isolation, providing responses based solely on their pre-trained data and algorithms, which can limit the diversity and depth of the generated content.

**Summary of the Invention**

The invention introduces a novel orchestration system termed "TriLLMOrchestrator" that coordinates the interaction between multiple artificial intelligence models, including but not limited to OpenAI's GPT (ChatGPT), Google's Gemini, and a locally hosted model referred to as Llama. This orchestration enhances the quality of the generated content by leveraging the strengths and mitigating the weaknesses of each individual model.

The system is designed to first gather initial responses to a given prompt from each participating AI model. Subsequently, it synthesizes these responses to create meta-prompts, eliciting a second level of responses aimed at integrating, refining, and improving the initial outputs. The final stage involves generating an "ultra response" that combines insights from the meta-responses, guided by predefined criteria to ensure the synthesis embodies the best qualities of the input.

**Detailed Description**

The described system employs an asynchronous, modular architecture that facilitates scalable interaction among different AI models. It integrates retry and rate-limiting mechanisms to handle API constraints and temporal efficiencies, ensuring robust and reliable operation. The system supports various response formatting options (plain text, markdown, JSON) to cater to different downstream applications and user preferences.

Central to the system's functionality are customizable templates for meta-prompts and ultra-prompts, which direct the iterative refinement process. These templates include placeholders for the original prompt and responses from each AI model, along with instructions for generating improved content.

An innovative aspect of the system is its ability to conduct a parallel process of "self-analysis" for patent purposes, applying its AI orchestration capabilities to evaluate and document its own code and functionality.
