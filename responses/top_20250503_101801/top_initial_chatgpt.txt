As of my last update in September 2023, compiling a list of specific angel investors targeting peer-to-peer sales platforms on college campuses, complete with their contact information, poses several challenges:

1. **Privacy**: Sharing direct contact links of angel investors without their explicit permission could violate privacy norms and even certain regulations.
2. **Dynamism**: The investment landscape, particularly in niche areas like peer-to-peer sales specifically for college campuses, is quite dynamic. Investors often shift their focus based on market trends, new opportunities, or personal investment strategies.
3. **Public Information Limitation**: Not all investments or investor preferences are publicly disclosed. Many angel investments happen through personal networks or closed platforms.

However, I can offer several strategies to identify potential investors and connect with them:

### General Approach to Finding Angel Investors:
- **Networking Through Incubators and Accelerators**: Joining a startup accelerator or incubator that focuses on higher education technology or marketplace platforms can be an effective way to meet angel investors. Many colleges and universities host their own incubator programs, which can be rich networking sources.
- **LinkedIn**: This platform is invaluable for networking with potential investors. Use LinkedIn to search for angel investors interested in education technology, marketplace platforms, or consumer apps. Many investors openly discuss their interests in their profiles.
- **AngelList**: This platform is designed specifically for startups looking for funding and investors looking for opportunities. You can find profiles of many investors, including their investment focus areas.
- **Attending Pitch Events**: Many universities and organizations host pitch events or competitions. These can attract angel investors interested in the educational tech space.
- **Angel Networks**: Some networks explicitly focus on educational technology. Examples include LearnLaunch, Edtech Angels, and others. Checking their member lists or attending events they sponsor could be productive.

### Virtual or Indirect Contact Strategies:
- **Professional Introductions**: Sometimes, the best way to connect is through a mutual connection. Use your network or your advisory board's network to get introductions.
- **Cold Outreach**: When done respectfully and sparingly, reaching out directly via email (after finding a contact through LinkedIn, Twitter, or personal blogs) can be effective. Personalize your message to demonstrate you've researched the investor and understand their investment thesis.

### Staying Informed and Compiling Your List:
Since providing a list of the top angels specifically for peer-to-peer sales on college campuses isn't feasible owing to the reasons mentioned, your best approach is to actively research and network within the spaces where these investors are likely to be. Look for investors who have backed companies in similar domains (e.g., marketplace platforms, college-focused startups, or peer-to-peer lending platforms).

Remember, the interest of angel investors can be very specific and often changes based on market trends, their current portfolio composition, and numerous other factors. Your goal should be to identify and connect with investors whose current interests align with your startup's value proposition. Always ensure to respect privacy and reach out in a professional manner that aligns with best practices for pitching to potential investors.
