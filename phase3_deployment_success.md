# Phase 3 Deployment Success! ðŸŽ‰

## Service URL Changed
The service is now deployed at: `https://ultrai-core.onrender.com/`
(Previously was: `https://ultra-backend.onrender.com/`)

## Verification Results

All endpoints are working correctly:

| Endpoint | Status | Response |
|----------|--------|----------|
| GET `/` | âœ… 200 | `{"status":"alive","phase":3}` |
| GET `/health` | âœ… 200 | `{"status":"ok","services":["api","auth"]}` |
| GET `/health/database` | âœ… 200 | Database not configured (expected) |
| POST `/auth/register` | âœ… 200 | User created successfully |
| POST `/auth/login` | âœ… 200 | JWT token generated |
| GET `/auth/verify` | âœ… 200 | Token validated |
| GET `/protected` | âœ… 200 | Protected endpoint accessed |

## Configuration That Worked

**Start Command**:
```
uvicorn app_with_auth:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

**Build Command**:
```
pip install -r requirements-phase3.txt
```

## Important Notes

1. The URL change from `ultra-backend` to `ultrai-core` needs to be updated in:
   - Any frontend configuration
   - Documentation
   - Environment variables
   - Test scripts

2. Database is not configured (shows warning) - this is expected for Phase 3

3. Invalid token handling returns 500 instead of 401 - minor improvement needed

## Next Steps

1. Update all references to use new URL: `https://ultrai-core.onrender.com/`
2. Configure database URL for full functionality
3. Optional: Improve error handling for invalid tokens (return 401 instead of 500)

The Phase 3 deployment with authentication is now fully operational!
