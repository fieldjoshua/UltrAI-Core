# LLM Service Degradation Analysis

## Root Cause Identified

The LLM service is marked as "degraded" but it's actually **partially functional**:

### Key Findings:

1. **OpenAI Models**: 🚫 Rate Limited
   - `gpt-4o-mini` returns "rate_limited" status
   - This is causing the health check to mark service as degraded

2. **Anthropic Models**: ✅ Working
   - `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` returns "available" status
   - Anthropic models are functional

3. **Orchestrator Health**: ✅ Healthy
   - The orchestration service itself is healthy
   - Issue is with model availability, not the service

4. **Check Availability Endpoint**: ❌ Errors
   - All provider checks return errors
   - This endpoint might have issues or require different parameters

## Why Service Shows Degraded

Looking at the health check logic, the service is likely marked degraded because:

1. **Not all providers are available** - OpenAI is rate limited
2. **Minimum model requirement** - The system might require at least 2 providers to be fully functional
3. **Health check criteria** - Any provider failure marks the entire service as degraded

## The Real Issue: OpenAI Rate Limiting

The diagnostic clearly shows:
```json
"gpt-4o-mini": {
    "status": "rate_limited",
    "cached": false
}
```

This suggests:
- OpenAI API key might be hitting rate limits
- Staging and production might be sharing the same API key
- Too many health checks or test requests

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fix:
1. **Use different API keys** for staging vs production
2. **Reduce health check frequency** for LLM providers
3. **Implement caching** for health checks (notice cache hits are 0)

### Code Fix Needed:
The health check logic should be more forgiving:
```python
# Current logic (probably):
if any_provider_unhealthy:
    mark_service_degraded()

# Better logic:
if minimum_providers_available >= 2:
    mark_service_healthy()
elif any_provider_available:
    mark_service_degraded()  # But still functional
else:
    mark_service_unhealthy()
```

### For Render Logs:
Look specifically for:
```
grep -i "rate.limit\|429\|openai" logs.txt
grep -i "health.*check.*llm" logs.txt
grep -i "minimum.*models\|required.*providers" logs.txt
```

## Testing Workaround

Since Anthropic models are working, you can:
1. Test orchestration using only Anthropic models
2. Disable OpenAI in staging temporarily
3. Or accept the "degraded" status as long as core functionality works

## Conclusion

The service is **functionally operational** but marked degraded due to OpenAI rate limiting. This is a configuration/limits issue, not a code bug. The fix requires either:
- Separate API keys for environments
- More lenient health check logic
- Rate limit management
