# Test Suite Audit Plan

## Objective
Identify tests that can be consolidated, removed, or improved to create a more maintainable and efficient test suite.

## Audit Criteria

### 1. Test Redundancy
- **Duplicate Coverage**: Tests that verify the same functionality
- **Overlapping Scenarios**: Tests with 80%+ similar assertions
- **Mock vs Real**: Tests that duplicate between mock and real implementations
- **Multiple Files**: Same component tested in different files

### 2. Test Quality Issues
- **No Assertions**: Tests that run code but don't verify outcomes
- **Weak Assertions**: Tests that only check for non-null or basic types
- **Over-Mocking**: Tests that mock everything, testing nothing real
- **Commented Tests**: Disabled tests that add no value

### 3. Test Performance
- **Slow Tests**: Tests taking >1 second that could be optimized
- **Flaky Tests**: Tests that fail intermittently
- **Heavy Setup**: Tests with excessive setup/teardown
- **Resource Intensive**: Tests that consume significant memory/CPU

### 4. Test Organization
- **Misplaced Tests**: Unit tests in integration folders, etc.
- **Poor Naming**: Tests with unclear purpose or naming
- **Missing Categories**: Tests without proper markers/categories
- **Dead Code**: Tests for deleted features

## Audit Process

### Phase 1: Discovery & Analysis
1. **Inventory all test files**
   - Count by directory
   - Categorize by type (unit, integration, e2e, etc.)
   - Identify test frameworks used

2. **Analyze test patterns**
   - Common test structures
   - Repeated test scenarios
   - Mock usage patterns

3. **Performance metrics**
   - Run tests with timing
   - Identify slowest 10%
   - Find resource-heavy tests

### Phase 2: Deep Analysis
1. **Coverage overlap analysis**
   - Map what each test covers
   - Find duplicate coverage
   - Identify gaps

2. **Quality assessment**
   - Count assertions per test
   - Evaluate assertion quality
   - Check for proper error testing

3. **Dependency analysis**
   - External service dependencies
   - Mock complexity
   - Setup/teardown overhead

### Phase 3: Recommendations
1. **Consolidation opportunities**
   - Tests to merge
   - Files to combine
   - Shared fixtures to create

2. **Removal candidates**
   - Redundant tests
   - Obsolete tests
   - Low-value tests

3. **Improvement areas**
   - Tests needing better assertions
   - Tests needing optimization
   - Tests needing better organization

## Expected Outcomes

### Metrics to Track
- Total test count (before/after)
- Test execution time (before/after)
- Code coverage percentage
- Test maintenance burden

### Deliverables
1. **Test Audit Report** with:
   - Current state analysis
   - Consolidation recommendations
   - Priority action items

2. **Test Refactoring Plan** with:
   - Specific files to modify
   - Tests to merge/remove
   - Timeline estimates

3. **Best Practices Guide** for:
   - Writing effective tests
   - Avoiding duplication
   - Test organization

## Success Criteria
- 20-30% reduction in test count without losing coverage
- 30-50% reduction in test execution time
- Clearer test organization and naming
- Easier test maintenance

## Tools to Use
- Coverage analysis tools
- Test timing/profiling
- Static analysis for test quality
- Dependency graphing

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 2-3 hours (Discovery)
- Phase 2: 3-4 hours (Analysis)
- Phase 3: 2-3 hours (Recommendations)
- Total: 7-10 hours for complete audit
