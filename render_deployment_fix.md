# Render Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The deployment was NOT failing due to SQLAlchemy (which was successfully installed).
The actual error was: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sse_starlette'`

## Root Cause

The `analyze_routes.py` file imports `sse_starlette` which was missing from requirements-render.txt:

```python
from sse_starlette.sse import EventSourceResponse
```

## Solution Applied

1. Added `sse-starlette==1.6.5` to requirements-render.txt
2. Committed and pushed (commit 5d508c99)

## Key Learnings

1. The error messages we were seeing were misleading
2. SQLAlchemy was installed correctly all along
3. The deployment logs clearly showed the real issue
4. Always check the FULL error traceback, not just partial errors

## Status

- ✓ Fixed missing sse-starlette dependency
- ⏳ Waiting for new deployment to complete
- ⏳ May discover more missing dependencies

## Configuration Used

- Render is using Python runtime (not Docker)
- Build command: `pip install -r requirements-render.txt`
- Start command: `gunicorn backend.app:app`
- Using render-prod.yaml configuration
