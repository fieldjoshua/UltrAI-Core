This code implements a method for detecting anomalies in a time series data by using a statistical approach. It utilizes the concept of the Box Plot Interquartile Range (IQR), a robust measure of spread, to identify outliers that deviate significantly from the normal distribution of the data.

**Provisional Patent Application Description:**

## Anomaly Detection Method for Time Series Data

**Abstract**

The present invention is directed to a method for detecting anomalies in time series data. The method is based on the statistical concept of the Box Plot Interquartile Range (IQR), which provides a robust measure of spread in the data. By identifying outliers that fall outside a predefined IQR threshold, the method can effectively detect anomalous patterns or events in the time series.

**Background**

Time series data, which represents a sequence of observations collected over time, often contains anomalies or outliers that can deviate significantly from the expected distribution. These anomalies can indicate unusual events, errors, or system malfunctions. Detecting anomalies in time series data is crucial for various applications, such as fault detection in manufacturing processes, fraud detection in financial transactions, and early detection of health issues.

**Detailed Description**

The proposed method utilizes the concept of the Box Plot IQR to identify anomalies in time series data. The IQR is a measure of the spread of data that is less sensitive to outliers than the standard deviation. It is calculated as the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles of the data.

Once the IQR is calculated, the method identifies anomalies as data points that fall outside a predefined IQR threshold. The threshold can be set to a multiple of the IQR, typically 1.5 or 3. Data points beyond this threshold are considered to be significantly different from the rest of the data and are flagged as anomalies.

The following steps summarize the method:

1. Calculate the median, 75th percentile, and 25th percentile of the time series data.
2. Compute the IQR as the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles.
3. Define an IQR threshold as a multiple of the IQR (e.g., 1.5 or 3).
4. Identify anomalies as data points that fall outside the IQR threshold.

**Advantages**

The proposed method offers several advantages over existing anomaly detection techniques:

* **Robustness:** It utilizes the IQR, which is less susceptible to outliers compared to the standard deviation.
* **Simplicity:** The method is straightforward to implement and requires only basic statistical calculations.
* **Tunable:** The IQR threshold can be adjusted to balance sensitivity and specificity in anomaly detection.

**Code:**

```python
import numpy as np

def detect_anomalies(data, threshold=3):
    """
    Detect anomalies in time series data using the Box Plot Interquartile Range (IQR).

    Parameters:
        data (list): The time series data to analyze.
        threshold (int): The multiple of the IQR used to define the anomaly threshold (default=3).

    Returns:
        list: A list of indices of the anomalous data points.
    """
    iqr = np.subtract(*np.percentile(data, [75, 25]))
    if iqr == 0:
        return []
    anomalies = [i for i, x in enumerate(data) if abs(x - np.median(data)) > threshold * iqr]
    return anomalies
```

}**Technical Field**

The present invention relates to the field of artificial intelligence and natural language processing. More specifically, it pertains to an advanced orchestration system for integrating and synthesizing responses from multiple artificial intelligence (AI) models to derive enhanced, synthesized insights from their collective intelligence.

**Background**

The integration of multiple AI models presents a significant challenge in the field of AI due to the varying outputs, rate limits, and processing capabilities of each model. Achieving a cohesive synthesis of information that leverages the strengths of each model remains a technical challenge. Current solutions typically rely on singular model outputs or manual integration processes, which neither scales nor fully utilizes the potential collective intelligence achievable through multi-model integration.

**Summary of the Invention**

The disclosed invention, named TriLLMOrchestrator, provides a novel system and method for the integration of multiple AI models to produce a synthesized, multi-layered analysis of a given prompt. This system utilizes a unique workflow to process the prompt through successive layers of analysis by different AI engines, including Llama, ChatGPT, and Gemini, each chosen for its specific strengths. The orchestration system ensures a cohesive operation amongst these models, managing rate limits, and optimizing for the best use of each model's capabilities, leading to a refined, high-quality output that surpasses what any single AI model could produce on its own.

**Detailed Description**

The TriLLMOrchestrator system initializes by setting up the necessary configurations for API keys, prompt templates, rate limits, and the specified output format. It then proceeds through a multi-stage process:

1. **Initial Response Generation:** The system sends the user's prompt to each AI model (Llama, ChatGPT, and Gemini) concurrently, abiding by each model's rate limits. The initial responses are then gathered.

2. **Meta Response Generation:** The system synthesizes the initial responses into a new prompt, which is then fed back to each AI model to derive a 'meta' analysis.

3. **Ultra Response Generation:** Depending on the specified ultra engine (Llama, ChatGPT, or Gemini), the system synthesizes the meta responses into a final prompt to generate an 'ultra' analysis.

4. **Hyper Response Generation:** A hyper-level analysis prompt is created based on all previous responses and is used to extract deep insights and patterns from the synthesis of all previous layers, leading to a comprehensive hyper analysis.

5. **Patent Analysis Task:** The system can also analyze its own operation and output for intellectual property documentation purposes, showing a reflective capability and self-aware AI integration.

Throughout these stages, the system employs asynchronous programming and retry mechanisms with exponential backoff to efficiently manage API calls, respecting each service's rate limits while optimizing for performance and reliability. The outputs are formatted according to specifications and saved, keeping a track of metadata for auditing and analysis purposes.

**Claims**

1. A method for synthesizing responses from multiple AI models incorporating asynchronous calls, rate limit management, and a multi-stage analysis pipeline to produce enhanced insights from a given input prompt.

2. The method of claim 1, wherein the AI models include Llama for local processing, ChatGPT for conversational AI synthesis, and Gemini for high-quality AI-generated content creation.

3. A system characterized by its ability to dynamically create meta and ultra prompts based on prior responses, enabling iterative refinement of the synthesized output.

4. The system of claim 3, further characterized by a hyper analysis stage that integrates insights from all previous stages to generate a comprehensive analysis and synthesis of ideas and recommendations.

5. A digital medium encoded with computer-readable instructions for executing the method of claim 1, capable of being implemented on a computer system.

**Code Implementation**

The detailed code implementation provided supports the claims and description of the functionality of the TriLLMOrchestrator. The code illustrates the technical infrastructure required to execute this innovative orchestration system, including API client initialization, asynchronous calls, rate limit management, response formatting, and the structured workflow for processing the prompts through the AI models to achieve the desired analytical outcomes.

The primary components of the system's code include definitions of data structures for prompt templates and rate limits, initialization and configuration of AI model clients, and the orchestration logic that manages the flow of data through the system. Further, it includes error handling, retry strategies for robustness, and the file system operations necessary for saving the outputs generated at each stage of the process.

This pioneering system leverages the distinguishing capabilities of modern AI models through an ingenious orchestration mechanism, demonstrating a novel approach to achieving comprehensive and higher-order analysis from diverse AI-generated inputs.**Technical Field**
