# UIConsolidation Action Plan

## Purpose

Consolidate UI-related actions (UIPrototypeIntegration, FRONTEND_DEVELOPMENT) into a single cohesive action to eliminate duplication, clarify the UI development roadmap, and ensure all frontend work follows a unified approach.

## Steps

- [x] Identify all UI-related actions in the codebase
  - UIPrototypeIntegration
  - FRONTEND_DEVELOPMENT

- [x] Analyze the content and purpose of each action
  - UIPrototypeIntegration: Core UI components and user experience
  - FRONTEND_DEVELOPMENT: General frontend development tasks

- [x] Consolidate documentation and plans
  - Use UIPrototypeIntegration as the primary action
  - Incorporate unique elements from FRONTEND_DEVELOPMENT
  - Ensure all objectives are captured

- [x] Update actions index
  - Mark consolidated actions appropriately
  - Document the rationale for consolidation
  - Clarify the status of all UI-related work

- [x] Preserve history and audit trail
  - Maintain original action directories for reference
  - Document the consolidation process
  - Ensure no work is lost during consolidation

## Success Criteria

- All UI-related functionality is properly documented in a single location
- No duplicate or conflicting UI development tasks exist
- Actions index reflects the consolidation
- Future UI work can follow a clear, unified plan
- Historical information is preserved for audit purposes

## Status: Completed

## Progress: 100%

## Notes

The following actions have been consolidated:

1. **UIPrototypeIntegration** (Primary action)
   - Core UI components:
     - PromptInput
     - LLMSelector
     - AnalysisPatternSelector
     - AnalysisResults
   - Additional features:
     - Export functionality
     - History management
     - User experience enhancements
     - Error handling

2. **FRONTEND_DEVELOPMENT** (Merged into UIPrototypeIntegration)
   - General frontend development tasks
   - UI standards and guidelines

All future UI development should reference the UIPrototypeIntegration action and its documentation, or the active ImprovementsRedux action that builds upon it.
