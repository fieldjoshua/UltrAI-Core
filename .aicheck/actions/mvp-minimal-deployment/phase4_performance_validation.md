# Phase 4: Performance Validation

## Objective
Validate that the minimal deployment meets performance requirements and document resource usage.

## Current Status
- Phase 2 app deployed successfully
- Root endpoint working: `{"status":"alive","phase":2}`
- Response times: ~250-280ms
- Database endpoint not yet configured

## Test Plan

### 1. Response Time Testing ✓
- Root endpoint (`/`): 254ms 
- Health endpoint (`/health`): 276ms
- Target: < 500ms ✓ PASS

### 2. Memory Usage Testing
- Check Render dashboard for memory metrics
- Target: < 512MB
- Document actual usage

### 3. Startup Time
- Review deployment logs
- Current: ~2 minutes build time
- Target: < 5 minutes ✓ PASS

### 4. Database Connectivity
- Add DATABASE_URL to test database health endpoint
- Verify connection works
- Measure query response time

### 5. Load Testing (Basic)
- Send 10 concurrent requests
- Measure response times under load
- Check for errors

## Next Steps

1. Document memory usage from Render dashboard
2. Configure DATABASE_URL for database testing
3. Run basic load tests
4. Update documentation with results
5. Prepare for Phase 5 (Authentication)
