# ACTION: phase3-authentication-deployment

Version: 1.0
Created: 2025-05-18
Status: IN_PROGRESS
Progress: 0%

## Objective

Deploy Phase 3 of the mvp-minimal deployment with authentication support, building on the successful Phase 2 deployment.

## Context

Phase 2 successfully deployed with:

- Database connectivity
- Average response time: ~270ms
- 100% uptime
- 27 minimal dependencies

## Todo List

- [x] **Create app_with_auth.py** - Phase 3 app with authentication endpoints (COMPLETED)

  - /auth/register
  - /auth/login
  - /auth/verify
  - Protected endpoint example

- [x] **Create requirements-phase3.txt** - Add authentication dependencies (COMPLETED)

  - PyJWT for token management
  - passlib for password hashing
  - python-jose for JWT handling
  - bcrypt for password encryption

- [x] **Update render.yaml** - Modify for Phase 3 deployment (COMPLETED)

  - Update build command to use requirements-phase3.txt
  - Update start command to use app_with_auth:app
  - Add JWT_SECRET environment variable

- [x] **Deploy to Render** - Deploy Phase 3 configuration (IN PROGRESS)

  - Push changes to repository
  - Monitor deployment logs
  - Verify successful deployment

- [ ] **Test authentication endpoints**

  - Test user registration
  - Test login flow
  - Test token verification
  - Test protected endpoint access

- [ ] **Document Phase 3 results**
  - Create phase3_deployment_success.md
  - Document performance metrics
  - Update deployment guide

## Success Criteria

1. All authentication endpoints working
2. JWT token generation/validation functioning
3. Password hashing implemented securely
4. Response times remain under 500ms
5. Zero errors during deployment

## Dependencies

- Completed Phase 2 deployment
- Database connectivity (from Phase 2)
- Render dashboard access

## Notes

- Build incrementally on Phase 2 success
- Use minimal approach for authentication
- Ensure backward compatibility with Phase 2 endpoints
