## Components

### 1. Activity Observer

The Activity Observer captures and logs user interactions within the UltraAI system.

#### Key Features

- **Event Listeners**: Capture UI interactions, query patterns, and feature usage
- **Session Tracking**: Maintain current session context and flow
- **Timing Analysis**: Detect hesitation, repeated actions, or efficiency patterns
- **Privacy Controls**: Respect user privacy settings and data minimization principles

#### Implementation Approach

- Use event delegation pattern for efficient event capturing
- Implement debouncing and throttling to avoid performance impact
- Store activity data in memory during session with configurable persistence

### 2. User Profile Data

Structured representation of user preferences, history, and expertise level.

#### Data Structure

```json
{
  "userId": "user123",
  "experienceLevel": "intermediate",
  "featureUsage": {
    "confidenceAnalysis": {
      "usageCount": 12,
      "lastUsed": "2025-04-28T14:30:00Z",
      "proficiency": "advanced"
    },
    "featherPatterns": {
      "usageCount": 8,
      "lastUsed": "2025-04-27T09:15:00Z",
      "proficiency": "intermediate"
    }
  },
  "preferences": {
    "theme": "neonNight",
    "animationLevel": "high",
    "suggestionFrequency": "medium"
  },
  "recentActivity": [
    {
      "type": "query",
      "action": "started",
      "target": "perspectiveAnalysis",
      "timestamp": "2025-04-29T09:30:00Z"
    },
    {
      "type": "feature",
      "action": "viewed",
      "target": "stakeholderVision",
      "timestamp": "2025-04-29T09:28:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Storage and Access

- Use IndexedDB for client-side storage
- Implement secure cloud sync for multi-device experience
- Provide data portability options

### 3. Pattern Detector

Analyzes user activity to identify opportunities for assistance, guidance, or feature suggestions.

#### Detection Patterns

- **Hesitation Detection**: Long pauses on specific screens or before actions
- **Repeated Actions**: Multiple attempts to accomplish a task
- **Inefficient Paths**: Using basic features when advanced options are available
- **Feature Exploration**: Browsing related features without selection
- **Error Recovery**: Patterns following error messages or failed operations

#### Implementation Approach

- Rule-based pattern matching for known behaviors
- Machine learning for pattern recognition (if available)
- Weighting system for confidence in detected patterns

### 4. Historical Analysis

Compares current activity with historical patterns to improve detection accuracy.

#### Analysis Methods

- Time series analysis of feature usage
- Comparison with similar user cohorts
- Feature adoption trajectory mapping
- Session comparison (current vs. previous)

#### Implementation Approach

- In-memory analysis for session comparison
- Scheduled background processing for deeper analysis
- Anonymized aggregate data usage (with appropriate permissions)

### 5. Context Generator

Transforms detected patterns and user context into structured data for the suggestion rules engine.

#### Output Structure

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-04-29T09:35:00Z",
  "userContext": {
    "experienceLevel": "intermediate",
    "currentActivity": "perspectiveAnalysis",
    "recentFeatures": ["stakeholderVision", "confidenceAnalysis"]
  },
  "detectedPatterns": [
    {
      "type": "hesitation",
      "target": "advancedOptions",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "context": "userViewedOptionsTwiceWithoutSelection"
    }
  ],
  "suggestionTriggers": [
    {
      "type": "featureDiscovery",
      "target": "timeHorizonAnalysis",
      "relevance": 0.9,
      "reason": "complementsCurrentPerspectiveAnalysis"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 6. Suggestion Context

The final output sent to the Suggestion Rules Engine for processing.

#### Integration Points

- API endpoint for Suggestion Rules Engine
- WebSocket for real-time suggestion updates
- Analytics pipeline for suggestion effectiveness tracking

## Design Considerations

### Performance Impact

- Implement progressive enhancement approach
- Use background workers for intensive processing
- Batch processing for historical analysis

### Privacy & Security

- Clear opt-in/opt-out controls
- Transparent data usage explanation
- Data minimization principles
- Local-first processing where possible

### Cyberpunk UI Elements

- Subtle visual indicators for active observation
- "System monitoring" aesthetic for settings
- Terminal-inspired analytics view (optional)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1 (MVP)

- Basic activity tracking (clicks, page views, features used)
- Simple rule-based pattern detection
- Local user profile storage
- Initial context generation

### Phase 2

- Advanced pattern detection
- Historical analysis integration
- Enhanced user profile with experience levels
- Real-time context updates

### Phase 3

- Machine learning pattern detection (if applicable)
- Predictive suggestion context
- Full integration with all UltraAI features
- Comprehensive analytics

## Success Metrics

- Pattern detection accuracy (manual audit)
- Suggestion relevance improvement
- Performance impact (< 5% CPU overhead)
- User opt-in rate (target: 85%+)

## Next Steps

1. Implement Activity Observer core functionality
2. Create User Profile data structure and storage
3. Develop basic Pattern Detector rules
4. Design Context Generator API
5. Integration testing with suggestion engine
