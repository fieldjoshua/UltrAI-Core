## Implementation Notes

### Current Focus

Completed work on the Context Analyzer component of the Suggestion Engine, including:

- Designed the component architecture with clear interfaces
- Implemented ActivityObserver for tracking user interactions
- Created UserProfile module for managing user preferences and experience levels
- Added test suite for the ActivityObserver component

Next focusing on creating the suggestion rules engine.

### Next Steps

1. Design the rules engine architecture
2. Define the rule format and evaluation logic
3. Create the ranking algorithm for suggestion priorities
4. Begin work on UI components for displaying suggestions

### Blockers

None currently identified.
