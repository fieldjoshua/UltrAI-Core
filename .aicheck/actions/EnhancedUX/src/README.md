# EnhancedUX Implementation

This directory contains the implementation of the EnhancedUX action components, focusing on improving the user experience in the UltraAI system.

## Code Structure

The implementation follows a modular architecture with clear interfaces between components.

### Context Analyzer

The Context Analyzer module observes and analyzes user activity to provide intelligent suggestions:

- `activity_observer.js` - Tracks user interactions with the system
- `user_profile.js` - Manages user preferences and experience levels
- `pattern_detector.js` (coming soon) - Identifies patterns in user behavior
- `context_generator.js` (coming soon) - Transforms patterns into suggestion contexts

### Suggestion Engine

The Suggestion Engine generates and ranks personalized suggestions:

- `suggestion_rules.js` - Defines core rules processing and evaluation logic
- `rule_definitions.js` - Contains rule definitions for various suggestion types
- `suggestion_ranking.js` (integrated in suggestion_rules.js) - Ranks suggestions by relevance
- `suggestion_feedback.js` - Collects and analyzes user feedback on suggestions
- `suggestion_presenter.js` - Transforms suggestions into cyberpunk-themed UI components

### Feature Discovery

The Feature Discovery system guides users to discover new features:

- `feature_discovery/` - Components for progressive feature discovery
  - `ProgressiveDisclosure.jsx` - Shows/hides UI elements based on user experience
  - `ProgressiveDisclosure.basic.jsx` - Simplified version with inline styles
  - `experience_tracker.js` - Tracks user experience level and progression
  - `achievement_system.js` - Gamifies feature discovery with achievements

### Personalization Framework

The Personalization Framework allows customization of the UltraAI experience:

- `personalization/` - Components for theme and preference management
  - `ThemeManager.js` - Core theme management functionality
  - `ThemeProvider.jsx` - React context provider for themes
  - `ThemeSwitcher.jsx` - UI component for theme selection
  - `index.js` - Exports all personalization components
- `preferences_manager.js` (coming soon) - Handles additional user preferences
- `layout_customizer.js` (coming soon) - Customizes interface layouts

### UI Components

The UI component library provides cyberpunk-styled interface elements:

- `components/` - Reusable UI components
  - `ContextualHelp.jsx` - Full-featured contextual help tooltip system
  - `ContextualHelp.basic.jsx` - Simplified version with minimal styling
  - `GuidedTour.jsx` - Interactive guided tours of features
  - More components coming soon

### Demo Components

Demo components showcase the EnhancedUX features:

- `demo/` - Demo applications
  - `FeatureDiscoveryDemo.jsx` - Demonstrates the progressive disclosure system
  - `MinimalDemo.jsx` - Simplified demo with minimal styling
  - `PersonalizationDemo.jsx` - Demonstrates theme switching and customization

## Development

### Getting Started

To use the suggestion system in your application:

```javascript
// Import the suggestion system
const {
  createSuggestionSystem,
  rules,
  FEEDBACK_TYPES,
  COMPONENT_TYPES
} = require('./index');

// Create and initialize the suggestion system
const suggestionSystem = createSuggestionSystem({
  autoStart: true,
  profile: {
    // User profile configuration
    userId: 'user123',
    experienceLevel: 'intermediate'
  },
  rules: rules, // Can pass a subset of rules if needed
  feedback: {
    // Feedback system configuration
    storageKey: 'ultra_suggestion_feedback',
    maxStorageItems: 100,
    analyticsEnabled: true
  },
  // Presenter configuration
  position: 'bottom-right',
  theme: 'standard',
  animationsEnabled: true,
  maxVisibleSuggestions: 1
});

// Generate suggestions and display them to the user
suggestionSystem.showSuggestions(COMPONENT_TYPES.CARD);

// Record user feedback when they interact with a suggestion
suggestionSystem.recordFeedback(
  'suggestion-id',
  FEEDBACK_TYPES.ACCEPTED,
  { actionTaken: 'featureActivated' }
);

// Analyze suggestion performance to get recommendations for improvement
const analysis = suggestionSystem.analyzePerformance();
console.log(analysis.recommendations);

// Dismiss all suggestions
suggestionSystem.dismissAllSuggestions();
```

### Using the Personalization Framework

To implement theme customization in your application:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider, useTheme, ThemeSwitcher, THEMES } from './personalization';

// Wrap your application with the ThemeProvider
function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider initialTheme={THEMES.CYBERPUNK}>
      <MainContent />
      <ThemeSwitcher />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

// Access theme properties in your components
function MainContent() {
  const { themeSettings, currentTheme, setTheme } = useTheme();

  return (
    <div style={{
      backgroundColor: themeSettings.backgroundColor,
      color: themeSettings.textColor,
      fontFamily: themeSettings.fontFamily,
    }}>
      <h1>Theme-aware Component</h1>
      <p>This component adapts to the selected theme.</p>
      <button onClick={() => setTheme(THEMES.DARK)}>
        Switch to Dark Theme
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Testing

Each component includes a corresponding test suite in the `/tests` directory:

```bash
npm run test
```

### Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling documentation is available at:

```
.aicheck/actions/EnhancedUX/docs/ERROR_HANDLING.md
```

This provides guidance on common errors, recovery steps, and debugging tips.

### Design Documents

Design documents for each component are available in the root directory:

```
.aicheck/actions/EnhancedUX/
  ├── context_analyzer_design.md
  ├── suggestion_rules_design.md
  └── ...
```

## Integration

The EnhancedUX components integrate with the UltraAI system through standardized APIs:

- Custom events for real-time interactions
- Shared context through the Context Analyzer
- Persistent user settings in the User Profile and Theme Manager
