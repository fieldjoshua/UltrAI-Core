# EnhancedUX Implementation

This directory contains the implementation of the EnhancedUX action components, focusing on improving the user experience in the UltraAI system.

## Code Structure

The implementation follows a modular architecture with clear interfaces between components.

### Context Analyzer

The Context Analyzer module observes and analyzes user activity to provide intelligent suggestions:

- `activity_observer.js` - Tracks user interactions with the system
- `user_profile.js` - Manages user preferences and experience levels
- `pattern_detector.js` (coming soon) - Identifies patterns in user behavior
- `context_generator.js` (coming soon) - Transforms patterns into suggestion contexts

### Suggestion Engine

The Suggestion Engine generates and ranks personalized suggestions:

- `suggestion_rules.js` (coming soon) - Defines rules for generating suggestions
- `suggestion_ranking.js` (coming soon) - Ranks suggestions by relevance
- `suggestion_presenter.js` (coming soon) - Prepares suggestions for display

### Feature Discovery

The Feature Discovery system guides users to discover new features:

- `experience_tracker.js` (coming soon) - Tracks user experience level
- `feature_tour.js` (coming soon) - Provides guided tours of features
- `achievement_system.js` (coming soon) - Gamifies feature discovery

### Personalization Framework

The Personalization Framework allows customization of the UltraAI experience:

- `theme_manager.js` (coming soon) - Manages visual themes
- `preferences_manager.js` (coming soon) - Handles user preferences
- `layout_customizer.js` (coming soon) - Customizes interface layouts

## Development

### Testing

Each component includes a corresponding test suite in the `/tests` directory:

```
tests/
  ├── activity_observer.test.js
  ├── user_profile.test.js
  └── ...
```

Run tests with:

```bash
npm run test
```

### Design Documents

Design documents for each component are available in the root directory:

```
.aicheck/actions/EnhancedUX/
  ├── context_analyzer_design.md
  ├── suggestion_engine_design.md (coming soon)
  └── ...
```

## Integration

The EnhancedUX components integrate with the UltraAI system through standardized APIs:

- Custom events for real-time interactions
- Shared context through the Context Analyzer
- Persistent user settings in the User Profile
