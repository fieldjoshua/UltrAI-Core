# Training Recommendations Implementation Plan

## Overview

**Status:** Planning
**Created:** 2025-05-15
**Priority:** 6 of 6

This action implements a skills gap analysis and training plan generator that analyzes codebase patterns, identifies team skill gaps, and creates customized training curricula to improve team capabilities and code quality.

## Objectives

1. Create automated codebase technology usage analysis
2. Build skill gap identification system
3. Develop personalized training recommendation engine
4. Generate custom learning paths
5. Track skill development progress

## Value to the Project

This action provides Ultra with:

1. **Targeted skill development** improving team efficiency
2. **Reduced knowledge silos** through gap identification
3. **Data-driven training budgets** with clear ROI
4. **Improved code quality** through skill enhancement
5. **Retention improvement** via career development

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Usage Analysis (Week 1)

   - Advanced feature usage
   - Architecture patterns

3. **Team Attribution**
   - Code ownership mapping
   - Contribution analysis
   - Review participation

### Phase 2: Skill Assessment (Week 2)

1. **Gap Identifier**

   - Compare usage vs expertise
   - Identify knowledge silos
   - Find training opportunities

2. **Proficiency Scoring**

   - Individual skill levels
   - Team capability matrix
   - Technology coverage

3. **Priority Calculator**
   - Business impact weighting
   - Risk assessment
   - ROI calculation

### Phase 3: Recommendation Engine (Week 3)

1. **Learning Path Generator**

   - Prerequisite mapping
   - Progressive skill building
   - Time estimation

2. **Resource Matcher**

   - Course recommendations
   - Book suggestions
   - Tutorial selection

3. **Curriculum Builder**
   - Individual plans
   - Team workshops
   - Mentorship pairing

### Phase 4: Progress Tracking (Week 4)

1. **Skill Tracking System**

   - Progress monitoring
   - Assessment integration
   - Competency verification

2. **ROI Measurement**
   - Code quality improvements
   - Velocity changes
   - Knowledge sharing metrics
