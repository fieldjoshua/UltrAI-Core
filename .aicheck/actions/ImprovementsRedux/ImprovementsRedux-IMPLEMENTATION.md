## Notes

This implementation plan focuses on the highest impact improvements first, while aligning with UltraAI's core vision of intelligence multiplication and democratizing AI access. The addition of user experience, guidance features, and feather pattern enhancements directly supports the vision of "lowering barriers to benefiting from AI" and "strategically playing premium LLMs off one another."

Progress will be tracked in this document with regular updates to the checklist items.
