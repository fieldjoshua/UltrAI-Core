# ACTION CANCELLED: eliminate-frontend-service

**Cancellation Date:** 2025-05-24
**Cancelled By:** Claude (Action Consolidation)
**Reason:** Frontend service is working successfully

## Why This Action Was Cancelled

1. **Frontend service is working perfectly** at https://ultrai-core.onrender.com/
2. **Single-service architecture successfully deployed**
3. **No broken frontend deployment to eliminate**
4. **Would break currently functional system**

## Current State

- ✅ Frontend service returns 200 OK
- ✅ Sophisticated UI serving successfully
- ✅ Single FastAPI service handles both API and frontend
- ✅ No separate frontend service complexity

## Redirect Focus

Instead of eliminating working services, focus on:
**`orchestration-integration-fix`** - Making the patent-protected orchestration features accessible through the working frontend.

This preserves the successful deployment architecture while enhancing functionality.
