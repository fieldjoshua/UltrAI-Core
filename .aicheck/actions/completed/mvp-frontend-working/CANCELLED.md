# ACTION CANCELLED: mvp-frontend-working

**Cancellation Date:** 2025-05-24
**Cancelled By:** Claude (Action Consolidation)
**Reason:** Sophisticated frontend already deployed and working

## Why This Action Was Cancelled

1. **Sophisticated frontend is live and working** at https://ultrai-core.onrender.com/
2. **This action would have downgraded the UI** to a "single-file HTML" approach
3. **Current sophisticated UI preserves UltraAI's competitive advantages**
4. **No need to rebuild what's already working well**

## Current State

- ✅ Sophisticated frontend deployed successfully
- ✅ Single-service architecture working (backend serves both API and frontend)  
- ✅ Authentication and document upload functional
- ✅ Professional UI preserving UltraAI brand

## Redirect Focus

Instead of rebuilding the frontend, all effort is now focused on:
**`orchestration-integration-fix`** - Connecting the sophisticated patent-protected orchestration features to the working UI.

This preserves the sophisticated interface while enabling the 4-stage Feather analysis and model selection capabilities that differentiate UltraAI.
