# Action: PROTOTYPE_IMPLEMENTATION

Created: 2025-04-25

## Objective

Implement the core prototype of the UltraAI system, focusing on the essential architecture and functionality.

## Context

This is a Priority 1 (Core Architecture) action that establishes the foundation for all components. The prototype implementation will serve as the basis for all subsequent development work.

## Requirements

1. Core Architecture
   - Implement FastAPI backend with proper configuration
   - Set up Pydantic models and settings
   - Establish proper error handling
   - Configure CORS and security settings

2. Essential Features
   - Basic API endpoints structure
   - Configuration management
   - Error handling system
   - Documentation setup

3. Quality Standards
   - Follow Python best practices
   - Maintain proper type hints
   - Document all major components
   - Ensure proper error handling

## Implementation Plan

1. Backend Setup
   - [x] Configure FastAPI application
   - [x] Set up Pydantic settings
   - [x] Implement CORS configuration
   - [x] Add proper error handling
   - [x] Set up logging system

2. Core Components
   - [x] Create base models
   - [x] Implement API routers
   - [x] Set up database models
   - [x] Add authentication system

3. Documentation
   - [ ] Add API documentation
   - [ ] Create development guides
   - [ ] Document configuration options
   - [ ] Add setup instructions

## Status

Status: In Progress
Progress: 50%

## Dependencies

- FastAPI
- Pydantic
- SQLAlchemy
- Python-dotenv
- Loguru
- Email-validator
- aiosqlite
- python-jose[cryptography]
- passlib[bcrypt]

## Notes

- This is a core architecture action that must be completed before other actions can proceed
- Focus on establishing solid foundations rather than feature completeness
- Ensure all components are properly documented
