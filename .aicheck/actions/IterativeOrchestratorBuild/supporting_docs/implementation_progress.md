# Implementation Progress

This document tracks the progress of the Iterative Orchestrator Build action.

## Phase 1: Directory Structure and Core Components

**Status: Completed**

- [x] Created directory structure:
  - [x] `/src/orchestration`
  - [x] `/src/adapters`
  - [x] `/src/services`
  - [x] `/src/cli`
  - [x] `/tests/unit/orchestration`
  - [x] `/tests/unit/adapters`

- [x] Implemented core configuration classes:
  - [x] `LLMProvider` enum
  - [x] `ModelConfig` class
  - [x] `OrchestratorConfig` class
  - [x] `RequestConfig` class

- [x] Implemented base adapter interface:
  - [x] `BaseAdapter` abstract class
  - [x] `adapter_factory.py` for adapter creation
  - [x] `mock_adapter.py` for testing and development

- [x] Implemented base orchestrator:
  - [x] `BaseOrchestrator` class
  - [x] `OrchestratorResponse` container
  - [x] Request execution logic
  - [x] Model management methods

- [x] Implemented CLI interface:
  - [x] `analyzer.py` command-line tool
  - [x] Interactive mode
  - [x] Model selection
  - [x] Output formatting

- [x] Created documentation:
  - [x] README files for each directory
  - [x] Code documentation
  - [x] Usage examples

- [x] Created unit tests:
  - [x] Base orchestrator tests

## Phase 2: Provider-Specific Adapters (In Progress)

- [ ] Implement provider-specific adapters:
  - [ ] `openai_adapter.py`
  - [ ] `anthropic_adapter.py`
  - [ ] `google_adapter.py`
  - [ ] `cohere_adapter.py`
  - [ ] `mistral_adapter.py`
  - [ ] `custom_adapter.py`

- [ ] Implement unit tests for each adapter
- [ ] Create integration tests for each provider

## Phase 3: Enhanced Orchestrator

- [ ] Design and implement `EnhancedOrchestrator`:
  - [ ] Analysis patterns
  - [ ] Circuit breakers
  - [ ] Caching
  - [ ] Advanced response synthesis
  - [ ] Progress tracking
  - [ ] Resource optimization

- [ ] Implement service layer for orchestration

## Phase 4: Integration with Existing Systems

- [ ] Update API routes to use new orchestration system
- [ ] Migrate existing functionality
- [ ] Implement compatibility layer for backward compatibility

## Phase 5: Documentation and Testing

- [ ] Comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Full test coverage
- [ ] Examples and tutorials
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

## Next Steps

1. Implement the OpenAI adapter (highest priority due to common usage)
2. Implement the Anthropic adapter
3. Write integration tests for real API calls
4. Begin implementing the EnhancedOrchestrator

## Issues and Challenges

- Need to handle streaming responses in adapters
- Need to ensure graceful failure handling across providers
- Need to optimize parallel execution for best performance
