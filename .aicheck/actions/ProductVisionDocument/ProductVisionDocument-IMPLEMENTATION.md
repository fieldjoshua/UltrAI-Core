## Notes
The product vision document has been completed based on comprehensive codebase analysis. It provides a clear picture of UltraAI's features, user experience, value proposition, and future roadmap. The document captures the essence of UltraAI's intelligence multiplication approach and the specialized "feather" patterns that enable it to achieve results greater than the sum of individual models.
