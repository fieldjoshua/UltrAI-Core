# SimpleOrchestratorCore Action Plan

## Overview

**Status:** Not Started  
**Created:** 2025-05-03  
**Last Updated:** 2025-05-03  
**Expected Completion:** 2025-05-05  

## Goal

Create a simplified core LLM orchestration system that eliminates complexity and provides the most direct path from request to response. This minimalist implementation will serve as the foundation for more advanced functionality while remaining efficient and maintainable.

## Value to Program

This action directly addresses core functionality issues in the Ultra system by:

1. Simplifying the orchestration flow to reduce complexity and improve maintainability
2. Creating a minimalist design with clear interfaces between components
3. Eliminating redundant abstractions and overlapping functionality
4. Providing a solid foundation for incremental enhancements
5. Enabling more direct testing and validation of core functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create a simplified `Config` class that consolidates all configuration in one place
- [ ] Implement a streamlined `Orchestrator` with core request processing
- [ ] Create a minimal `Adapter` interface with mock implementation
- [ ] Develop a simple factory function for orchestrator creation
- [ ] Implement basic parallel execution of requests
- [ ] Provide a clear and simple response format
- [ ] Create comprehensive tests demonstrating functionality
- [ ] Document the architecture and usage

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Components (Day 1)

1. Create simplified configuration structure:
   - Single `Config` class with model definitions
   - Simple validation and defaults

2. Implement core adapter interface:
   - Minimal `Adapter` interface with only essential methods
   - Mock adapter implementation for testing

3. Create factory function:
   - Simple function to create orchestrator with adapters
   - Support for mock mode and testing

### Phase 2: Orchestrator Implementation (Day 1-2)

1. Implement streamlined orchestrator:
   - Single process method for handling requests
   - Built-in parallel execution
   - Simple response handling
   - Basic error management

2. Create test harness:
   - Unit tests for core functionality
   - Integration test for end-to-end flow
   - Mock adapter tests

### Phase 3: Documentation and Examples (Day 2)

1. Document architecture:
   - Component overview
   - Flow diagrams
   - Extension points

2. Create usage examples:
   - Basic usage patterns
   - Configuration examples
   - Mock and real adapter examples

## Dependencies

- Existing MultiLLMOrchestrator in `src/orchestrator.py`
- BaseOrchestrator in `src/orchestration/base_orchestrator.py`
- Adapter interfaces in `src/adapters/`

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Oversimplification loses critical functionality | Medium | Create feature matrix comparing old and new implementations |
| Integration challenges with existing code | Medium | Create clear interface boundaries with adapters for legacy code |
| Performance regression | Low | Benchmark against existing implementation |

## Technical Design

The simplified orchestrator will follow this data flow:

1. **Configuration**:
   - Single `Config` object containing model details and orchestration settings

2. **Orchestrator Creation**:
   - Factory function creates orchestrator with pre-configured adapters

3. **Request Processing**:
   - Single unified method handles routing to appropriate models
   - Parallel execution built in by default

4. **Response Handling**:
   - Simple response format with primary result and metadata
