# OrchestratorRefactor Action Plan

## Purpose

Refactor the Multi-LLM Orchestrator to efficiently handle prompt processing with dynamic LLM selection and analysis pattern application for the prototype, without complex features.

## Steps

- [x] Simplify model registration to work with different LLM providers
- [x] Enhance the orchestrator to accept and apply analysis patterns
- [x] Optimize the processing pipeline for efficiency
- [x] Implement better progress tracking and status updates
- [x] Improve error handling and recovery
- [x] Add configuration options for different analysis modes
- [x] Create helper methods for common analysis operations

## Success Criteria

- Orchestrator can dynamically use models from different providers
- Analysis patterns are correctly applied to prompts
- The processing pipeline is efficient for multi-stage analysis
- Progress is tracked and reported accurately
- Errors are handled gracefully with recovery options
- Configuration is flexible enough for different analysis needs
- The code is clean, modular, and well-documented
