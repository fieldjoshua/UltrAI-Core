# Deployment Verification - Basic Orchestrator

## Deployment Information
- **Date**: 2025-01-06
- **Commit**: 8413dc8a (Add basic orchestrator for iterative development)
- **Branch**: main
- **Service**: ultrai-core on Render

## Changes Deployed
1. Re-enabled orchestrator routes in app.py
2. Added BasicOrchestrator service focusing on reliability
3. Added toggle between basic and minimal orchestrator
4. Comprehensive error handling and timeouts

## Production URLs to Test
- Health Check: https://ultrai-core.onrender.com/health
- Orchestrator Health: https://ultrai-core.onrender.com/api/orchestrator/health
- Available Models: https://ultrai-core.onrender.com/api/orchestrator/models
- Feather Endpoint: https://ultrai-core.onrender.com/api/orchestrator/feather

## Test Plan
1. Wait for deployment to complete on Render
2. Test health endpoints first
3. Test orchestrator with basic prompt
4. Verify response times under 10 seconds
5. Check error handling with invalid models

## Test Results
**Test Date**: 2025-01-06
**Deployment Status**: LIVE

### Health Check ✅
- [x] Production URL responds
- [x] Status: "ok"
- [x] Timestamp: 2025-06-05T23:32:01
- [x] Uptime confirmed: 0:01:14

### Orchestrator Health ✅
- [x] Endpoint responds
- [x] Shows available adapters: 5
- [x] Available providers: ["openai", "anthropic", "google"]
- [x] Timestamp: Verified

### Available Models ✅
- [x] Lists models correctly
- [x] Shows correct providers
- [x] Models available:
  - gpt4o (openai)
  - gpt4turbo (openai)
  - claude37 (anthropic)
  - claude3opus (anthropic)
  - gemini15 (google)

### Feather Endpoint Test ⚠️
- [x] Endpoint exists and responds
- [ ] CSRF protection blocking direct API calls
- [ ] Returns responses from multiple models
- [ ] Response time under 10 seconds
- [ ] Needs CSRF token handling or auth disabled

### Error Handling Test
- [ ] Invalid model handled gracefully
- [ ] Empty prompt rejected
- [ ] Timeout protection works
- [ ] Blocked by CSRF currently

## Issues Found
1. CSRF protection is enabled (ENABLE_AUTH=true)
2. API calls require CSRF token handling
3. Direct curl/API testing blocked without proper auth flow

## Next Steps
1. Either:
   - Implement proper CSRF token handling in tests
   - Temporarily disable auth for testing
   - Create a test endpoint that bypasses CSRF
2. Test with frontend UI if available
3. Monitor production logs for any errors

## Environment Variables Required
```
USE_BASIC_ORCHESTRATOR=true  # To use basic orchestrator
OPENAI_API_KEY=xxx
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=xxx
GOOGLE_API_KEY=xxx
```

## Next Steps
After successful deployment:
1. Monitor logs for any errors
2. Test with frontend if available
3. Document any issues found
4. Plan next iteration (synthesis feature)
