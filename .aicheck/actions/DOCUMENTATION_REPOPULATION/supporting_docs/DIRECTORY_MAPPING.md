## Plans to be Created

Based on the directory mapping, these additional plans will need to be created:

1. DOCUMENT_PROCESSING_PLAN - For document handling and storage
2. DATA_MANAGEMENT_PLAN - For data storage, caching, and database operations
3. TESTING_STRATEGY_PLAN - For all testing-related functionality
4. DEPLOYMENT_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN - For deployment and infrastructure
5. CLOUD_INTEGRATION_PLAN - For cloud-specific functionality
6. FRONTEND_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN - For frontend application

## Next Steps

1. Create directory placeholders for missing plans in `documentation/Plans/`
2. Incorporate these plans into the PLANS_INDEX.md
3. Update the Implementation Roadmap to include all identified plans
4. Begin migrating existing documentation for each area
