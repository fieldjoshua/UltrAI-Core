# Action Index Automation Plan

## Objective

Create an automated system for maintaining an up-to-date HTML index of all actions in the UltraAI project.

## Background

The UltraAI project has numerous action directories that define specific tasks, improvements, and implementations. As the number of actions grows, it becomes difficult to maintain a clear overview of their status and contents.

## Success Criteria

- Generate an HTML index that displays all actions organized by status
- Implement search functionality to filter actions
- Extract relevant keywords from action files for improved searchability
- Create an automation system that keeps the index up-to-date as files change
- Integrate with Git to automatically update when changes are committed

## Steps

1. Create a Python script to scan the actions directory structure
2. Generate an HTML index with responsive design
3. Implement status categorization (completed, in-progress, planning, pending)
4. Add search and filtering functionality
5. Extract keywords from action files for improved searchability
6. Create Git hooks to automatically update the index when relevant files change
7. Add a file watcher for real-time updates during development
8. Create comprehensive documentation

## Files

- `/update_index.py`: Python script for generating the HTML index
- `/watch_and_update.sh`: Shell script for watching file changes
- `/setup_git_hook.sh`: Script for setting up Git hooks
- `/index.html`: The generated HTML index
- `/README.md`: Documentation for the automation system

## Value

This automation will provide a clear overview of all actions in the project, making it easier to track progress, find specific actions, and understand the current state of the project.
