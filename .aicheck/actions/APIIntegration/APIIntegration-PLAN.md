# APIIntegration Action Plan (3 of 16)

## Purpose

Develop the necessary API endpoints to support the prototype's core functionality of prompt processing, LLM selection, and analysis without complex features like pricing, user accounts, or document attachments.

## Steps

- [x] Create endpoint for LLM availability and configuration
- [x] Implement endpoint for prompt submission and processing
- [x] Develop endpoint for analysis pattern selection
- [x] Build API for retrieving analysis results
- [x] Implement progress tracking endpoint for multi-stage analysis
- [x] Add error handling and response standardization
- [x] Create basic documentation for API endpoints

## Success Criteria

- API endpoints properly connect UI to backend processing
- LLM selection is properly passed to the orchestrator
- Prompts are correctly processed by selected LLMs
- Analysis patterns are applied as specified
- Results are returned in a consistent format
- Progress updates are provided for long-running analyses
- Errors are handled gracefully with meaningful messages

## Status: Completed

## Progress: 100%
