# UIPrototypeIntegration Action Plan

## Purpose

Create a functional prototype UI that allows users to submit prompts, select LLMs, and view analysis results without requiring pricing, user accounts, document attachments, or add-ons.

## Program Connection

This UI prototype is a critical component of the Ultra program, providing the primary interface for users to interact with the LLM analysis system. It bridges the gap between the backend API (completed in APIIntegration) and end users, enabling them to leverage the program's core functionality of multi-model analysis and pattern-based processing.

## Steps

- [ ] Create a basic prompt input component with submit functionality
- [ ] Develop an LLM selector interface using the existing model selector functionality
- [ ] Implement analysis pattern selection UI
- [ ] Build a results display component to show multi-LLM analysis output
- [ ] Integrate the UI components with the backend systems
- [ ] Add progress indicators for multi-stage analysis
- [ ] Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes

## Documentation Requirements

### Component Documentation

- Detailed documentation for each UI component
- Props and state management documentation
