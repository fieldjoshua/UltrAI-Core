# DockerComposeSetup Action - COMPLETED

This action has been completed. Docker Compose setup for Ultra has been fully implemented and documented.

## Summary

A comprehensive Docker Compose setup has been created that standardizes the development environment, making it easier for developers to get started with Ultra and ensuring consistent behavior across different development environments.

## Implementation

1. **Docker Compose Configuration**:

   - Created/updated `docker-compose.yml` with services for PostgreSQL, Redis, backend, and frontend
   - Added proper volume mounts for persistent data
   - Configured environment variables and networking
   - Added health checks for all services
   - Created a separate `docker-compose.ci.yml` for CI environments

2. **Environment Variable Setup**:

   - Updated `.env.example` with Docker-specific variables
   - Added Redis password configuration
   - Added Docker-specific build variables (TAG, BUILD_TARGET)
   - Added consistent restart policies via RESTART_POLICY

3. **PostgreSQL Configuration**:

   - Enhanced the PostgreSQL initialization script with additional tables and indexes
   - Added default data for development
   - Configured PostgreSQL to use a named volume for persistence

4. **Redis Configuration**:

   - Added password protection for Redis
   - Configured Redis to persist data to a volume
   - Updated health checks to work with password-protected Redis

5. **Startup Scripts**:

   - Verified `scripts/start-dev.sh` for starting the backend in development mode
   - Verified `scripts/worker.sh` for running background tasks
   - Created `scripts/start-docker.sh` as a convenience script for starting the Docker environment
   - Made all scripts executable

6. **Documentation**:
   - Added Docker Compose usage documentation in `documentation/docker_compose_setup.md`
   - Created README for Docker directory at `docker/README.md`
   - Added development workflow documentation at `.aicheck/actions/DockerComposeSetup/supporting_docs/development_workflow.md`

## Benefits

1. **Standardized Development**: Developers can now work in a consistent environment regardless of their local setup
2. **Simplified Onboarding**: New developers can get started with a single command
3. **Dependency Management**: All dependencies (PostgreSQL, Redis) are automatically configured
4. **Isolated Testing**: The CI configuration allows for isolated testing in CI pipelines
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Works well with the ErrorHandlingImprovement action by supporting both containerized and non-containerized development

## Future Work

1. **Integration Testing**: Add dedicated integration testing configurations
2. **Production Docker Compose**: Create a production-ready Docker Compose setup
3. **Docker Swarm/Kubernetes**: Extend to cluster deployment options
4. **Local Development Tools**: Add more developer tooling for Docker environment
