# Plan: DockerComposeSetup

## Overview

This plan aims to create a Docker Compose configuration for the Ultra project that provides a complete local development environment with all required services (Redis, PostgreSQL) pre-configured. This will standardize the development environment, simplify onboarding, and ensure consistent behavior across different developers' machines.

## Status

- **Current Phase**: Planning
- **Progress**: 0%
- **Owner**: DevOps Team
- **Started**: Not started
- **Target Completion**: 2 weeks after approval
- **Authority**: Standard Plan
- **Current Status**: PendingApproval

## Plan Review

### Novelty Verification

This plan does not duplicate existing work. The project currently has a basic Dockerfile but lacks a Docker Compose setup for orchestrating multiple services. The existing setup requires manual installation and configuration of Redis and PostgreSQL.

### Impact Assessment

This plan impacts:
- Local development workflow
- Developer onboarding process
- Testing environment setup
- CI/CD pipeline (potentially)
- Documentation

## Objectives

- Create a Docker Compose configuration that provides all required services
- Ensure backend connects properly to containerized services
- Simplify local development environment setup to a single command
- Ensure consistent behavior between different development environments
- Document the new Docker-based workflow

## Background

### Problem Statement

The current development workflow requires manual installation and configuration of Redis and PostgreSQL. This leads to inconsistent environments, difficult onboarding, and "works on my machine" issues.

### Current State

The system currently:
- Requires manual Redis and PostgreSQL installation and configuration
- Shows warnings when services are not available
- Has different behavior when certain services are missing
- Has a basic Dockerfile but no orchestration

### Desired Future State

The system will:
- Have a Docker Compose setup that provides all required services
- Allow developers to start the entire environment with a single command
- Ensure consistent behavior across different development environments
- Include sensible defaults and pre-seeded data for local development

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Research and Design

1. **Audit Service Requirements**
   - Document all external service dependencies
   - Determine configuration parameters for each service
   - Identify volume requirements for persistence
   - **Task Owner**: DevOps/Backend Developer

2. **Docker Compose Configuration Design**
   - Design service definitions
   - Plan networking between containers
   - Design volume mapping for persistence
   - **Task Owner**: DevOps Engineer

### Phase 2: Implementation

1. **Docker Compose File Creation**
   - Create docker-compose.yml file
   - Configure Redis service
   - Configure PostgreSQL service
   - Configure backend service
   - **Task Owner**: DevOps Engineer

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Create .env.example file with required variables
   - Update configuration to read from environment variables
   - Create initialization scripts for services
   - **Task Owner**: Backend Developer

3. **Testing**
   - Test service startup and communication
   - Verify data persistence
   - Test rebuild and restart scenarios
   - **Task Owner**: DevOps/QA

### Phase 3: Documentation and Integration

1. **Documentation**
   - Update CLAUDE.md with Docker Compose instructions
   - Create DOCKER.md with detailed Docker information
   - Update README.md with quick start instructions
   - **Task Owner**: Documentation/DevOps

2. **CI Integration**
   - Update CI configuration to use Docker Compose
   - Add Docker-based testing environment
   - **Task Owner**: DevOps/CI Engineer

## Success Criteria

1. Developer can start the entire environment with a single `docker-compose up` command
2. All services (Redis, PostgreSQL, backend) start and communicate correctly
3. Data persists between container restarts
4. Development environment mirrors production dependencies
5. Documentation clearly explains Docker-based workflow
6. No manual service installation required for new developers

## Timeline

| Timeframe | Focus | Key Deliverables |
|------|-------|------------------|
| Days 1-3 | Research and Design | Service configuration requirements doc |
| Days 4-8 | Implementation | Working docker-compose.yml with all services |
| Days 9-10 | Testing | Verification of multi-service functionality |
| Days 11-14 | Documentation and Integration | Updated docs and CI integration |

## Resources Required

- **Personnel**: 1 DevOps Engineer (primary), 1 Backend Developer, 1 Documentation contributor
- **Tools**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Time Commitment**: Approximately 2 developer-weeks

## Plan Documents

This plan includes the following documents:
- [DockerComposeSetup-PLAN.md](DockerComposeSetup-PLAN.md) - This document
- supporting_docs/service_requirements.md - Will contain service configuration analysis
- supporting_docs/docker_compose_flow.md - Will contain workflow documentation

## Related Documentation

- [CLAUDE.md](/CLAUDE.md) - Setup instructions that will be updated
- [Dockerfile](/Dockerfile) - Existing container definition
- [docker-compose.yml](/docker-compose.yml) - Will be created or updated

## Open Questions

- Should we include frontend services in the Docker Compose setup?
- How should we handle database migrations in the Docker environment?
- Should we provide different Docker Compose configurations for different scenarios (dev, test, etc.)?
