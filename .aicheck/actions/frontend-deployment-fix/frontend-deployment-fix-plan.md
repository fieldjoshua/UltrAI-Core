## Purpose

Fix the non-functional frontend deployment at https://ultrai-frontend.onrender.com/ which is currently returning 404. The frontend React app exists and is fully built but the Render deployment is failing.

## Requirements

- Ensure frontend properly connects to backend API
- Verify full user interface functionality
- Test complete user workflow through frontend

## Dependencies

- Backend API at ultrai-core.onrender.com (operational)
- render.yaml frontend service configuration
- Frontend build process and dependencies
- Render deployment service access

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Deployment Diagnosis (IMMEDIATE - 30 minutes)

- Check Render dashboard for frontend service status
- Analyze build logs for deployment failures
- Verify frontend configuration and build process
- Check for missing environment variables or build issues

### Phase 2: Configuration Fix (30 minutes)

- Fix any issues with render.yaml frontend configuration
- Ensure proper build commands and static file serving
- Verify API URL configuration for frontend
- Update any missing environment variables

### Phase 3: Deployment and Testing (30 minutes)

- Trigger new frontend deployment on Render
- Verify frontend loads and displays correctly
- Test user registration and login through frontend
- Validate document upload and analysis workflow
- Confirm frontend-backend integration

### Phase 4: Production Validation

- Complete end-to-end user workflow testing
- Performance and accessibility validation
- Error handling verification
- Mobile responsiveness check

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Frontend accessible at https://ultrai-frontend.onrender.com/
- ✅ User registration and login functional
- ✅ Document upload and processing working
- ✅ Analysis interface operational
- ✅ Full frontend-backend integration confirmed

## Estimated Timeline

- Diagnosis: 30 minutes
- Configuration fixes: 30 minutes  
- Deployment and testing: 30 minutes
- Validation: 30 minutes
- Total: 2 hours

## Notes

URGENT ACTION - Frontend deployment failure blocking user access to full application interface. Backend is 100% operational, frontend exists and is built, deployment configuration needs fixing.
