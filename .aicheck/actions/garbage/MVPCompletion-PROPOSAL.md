# Proposed Action: MVPCompletion

## Overview

This action proposes to implement the core MVP functionality of Ultra, focusing on enabling users to connect to multiple LLMs, conduct queries, and observe differences in analyses between models. While individual components like the Docker Model Runner have been implemented, this action will ensure all parts work together cohesively to deliver the complete MVP experience.

## Problem Statement

The Ultra system currently has many of the foundational components implemented (Docker Model Runner, frontend UI, etc.), but there needs to be a coordinated effort to ensure these components work together properly to deliver the core MVP value proposition: comparing responses from different LLMs. Some integration points may be incomplete or not fully functional.

## Proposed Action Components

1. **LLM Integration Verification**

   - Test connections to OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google APIs
   - Ensure all LLM adapters function properly
   - Verify seamless integration with Docker Model Runner for local models

2. **Core Comparison Flow Implementation**

   - Complete the `/api/analyze` endpoint functionality
   - Ensure proper orchestration of requests to multiple LLMs
   - Implement response aggregation and formatting

3. **Frontend Integration**

   - Complete model selection and comparison UI
   - Ensure proper display of response differences
   - Add loading states and error handling

4. **End-to-End Testing**

   - Create comprehensive tests for the full MVP flow
   - Validate with real API calls (where possible)
   - Create fallback mock scenarios for CI/CD environments

5. **Documentation**
   - Create user documentation for the MVP features
   - Document API endpoints and request formats
   - Add environment configuration documentation

## Success Criteria

1. User can select multiple LLM models for comparison
2. System can send the same prompt to multiple LLMs
3. Results are displayed in a side-by-side comparison view
4. Local models via Docker Model Runner work alongside cloud LLMs
5. Errors (API failures, etc.) are handled gracefully
6. End-to-end tests validate the complete functionality

## Implementation Plan

1. **Assessment Phase**

   - Review existing components and their integration points
   - Identify any gaps or incomplete functionality
   - Create a detailed task list for implementation

2. **Development Phase**

   - Implement missing components
   - Fix any integration issues
   - Ensure all components work together seamlessly

3. **Testing Phase**

   - Test each MVP feature individually
   - Perform end-to-end testing of the complete flow
   - Verify error handling and edge cases

4. **Documentation Phase**
   - Create user documentation
   - Update API documentation
   - Document configuration requirements

## Required Resources

- Access to LLM API keys for testing
- Local Docker environment for Docker Model Runner testing
- Frontend and backend development setup

## Timeline

Estimated completion time: 1 week

This action proposal is submitted for human manager approval.
