# ErrorHandlingImprovement Action Plan

## Status

- **Current Status:** PendingApproval
- **Progress:** 0%
- **Last Updated:** 2025-05-02

## Objective

Enhance Ultra's error handling for critical dependencies including PyJWT, passlib, and Redis to provide clearer error messages and graceful fallbacks when these dependencies are missing or misconfigured.

## Background

The Ultra system relies on several key dependencies that may not be properly installed or configured in all environments. When these dependencies are missing, the system currently fails with generic errors that are difficult to troubleshoot. This action aims to implement more robust error handling with specific error messages and, where possible, graceful fallbacks or degraded functionality.

## Steps

1. **Audit Dependency Usage**
   - [ ] Review all imports of PyJWT, passlib, and Redis across the codebase
   - [ ] Identify critical paths where these dependencies are required
   - [ ] Document current error handling approaches

2. **Design Error Handling Strategy**
   - [ ] Create standard exception types for dependency-related errors
   - [ ] Define graceful fallback behaviors where applicable
   - [ ] Design user-friendly error messages with troubleshooting steps

3. **Implement PyJWT Error Handling**
   - [ ] Add try-except blocks around PyJWT imports and operations
   - [ ] Create custom exceptions with clear error messages
   - [ ] Implement diagnostic checks to verify JWT configuration
   - [ ] Update documentation with JWT setup requirements

4. **Implement Passlib Error Handling**
   - [ ] Add try-except blocks around passlib imports and operations
   - [ ] Create custom exceptions with clear error messages
   - [ ] Add validation functions to check passlib availability
   - [ ] Update documentation with passlib setup requirements

5. **Implement Redis Error Handling**
   - [ ] Add connection validation and timeout handling for Redis
   - [ ] Implement a fallback mechanism when Redis is unavailable
   - [ ] Add configuration validation for Redis settings
   - [ ] Create debug tools to test Redis connectivity

6. **Update Error Documentation**
   - [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for dependency issues
   - [ ] Document common error scenarios and resolutions
   - [ ] Update API responses to include helpful error details

7. **Testing**
   - [ ] Create test cases for scenarios with missing dependencies
   - [ ] Verify error messages are clear and actionable
   - [ ] Test fallback mechanisms function as expected
   - [ ] Validate error handling in different environments

## Success Criteria

- Clear, specific error messages are displayed when PyJWT, passlib, or Redis are missing
- Where possible, the system degrades gracefully rather than failing completely
- Documentation includes detailed setup and troubleshooting guides for these dependencies
- Developers can quickly identify and resolve dependency-related issues
- All critical paths have proper error handling

## Technical Requirements

- Maintain backward compatibility with existing code
- Follow best practices for Python exception handling
- Implement consistent error message format across the application
- Provide logging with appropriate severity levels
- Ensure security is not compromised by error messages

## Dependencies

- None

## Timeline

- Start: TBD (After approval)
- Target Completion: TBD + 5 days
- Estimated Duration: 5 days

## Notes

This action focuses on improving developer and user experience by making dependency-related errors more transparent and actionable. It will reduce troubleshooting time and improve system resilience when dependencies are misconfigured.
