# HealthCheckImplementation Action Plan

## Status

- **Current Status:** PendingApproval
- **Progress:** 0%
- **Last Updated:** 2025-05-02

## Objective

Implement comprehensive health check endpoints in the Ultra system to verify connectivity and proper functioning of all external services, enabling easier monitoring, faster troubleshooting, and improved reliability.

## Background

The Ultra system relies on several external services such as LLM APIs, databases, and caching systems. Currently, there's no standardized way to verify if these services are functioning correctly, making it difficult to diagnose issues during deployment or runtime. Health check endpoints would provide a simple, consistent way to verify system health and detect problems before they impact users.

## Steps

1. **Audit External Service Dependencies**

   - [ ] Identify all external services used by Ultra (LLM APIs, database, Redis, etc.)
   - [ ] Document connectivity requirements for each service
   - [ ] Define criteria for "healthy" status for each service
   - [ ] Determine appropriate timeout values for health checks

2. **Design Health Check Architecture**

   - [ ] Define health check endpoint structure
   - [ ] Design standardized response format
   - [ ] Create health status schema with appropriate detail levels
   - [ ] Plan authentication/authorization for health endpoints
   - [ ] Determine caching strategy for health check results

3. **Implement Core Health Check Framework**

   - [ ] Create base health check controller
   - [ ] Implement overall system health endpoint
   - [ ] Develop health check registry for service registration
   - [ ] Add logging and metrics collection

4. **Implement Service-Specific Health Checks**

   - [ ] Create database connectivity check
   - [ ] Implement Redis connection verification
   - [ ] Add LLM API connectivity checks for each provider
   - [ ] Develop file system access verification
   - [ ] Add network service dependency checks

5. **Add Detailed Diagnostics**

   - [ ] Implement detailed diagnostics mode for troubleshooting
   - [ ] Add response time measurements for each service
   - [ ] Create configuration validation checks
   - [ ] Implement system resource verification

6. **Documentation and Integration**

   - [ ] Document all health check endpoints
   - [ ] Create troubleshooting guide based on health check results
   - [ ] Add health check URLs to monitoring documentation
   - [ ] Update deployment guides with health verification steps

7. **Testing**
   - [ ] Create automated tests for health check endpoints
   - [ ] Test failure scenarios for each service
   - [ ] Verify security of health endpoints
   - [ ] Load test health checks to ensure minimal performance impact

## Success Criteria

- System provides `/health` endpoint that returns overall system status
- Individual service health can be checked via specific endpoints
- Health checks verify actual connectivity, not just configuration
- Response format is consistent and machine-readable (JSON)
- Failures provide actionable error messages
- Health checks have minimal performance impact
- Documentation clearly explains how to use and interpret health checks

## Technical Requirements

- Health check endpoints follow REST best practices
- Authentication is required for detailed health information
- Sensitive configuration details are not exposed in responses
- Health checks are lightweight and complete within reasonable timeouts
- Response format follows standard conventions (HTTP status codes, JSON structure)

## Dependencies

- None

## Timeline

- Start: TBD (After approval)
- Target Completion: TBD + 5 days
- Estimated Duration: 5 days

## Notes

This action will significantly improve system observability and make troubleshooting more efficient. The health check endpoints will be valuable not only for monitoring but also for deployment verification and CI/CD pipelines.
