# Plan: DockerModelRunnerIntegration

## Overview

This plan outlines the integration of Docker Model Runner with the Ultra multi-LLM analysis platform. Docker Model Runner enables running open-source AI models locally with an OpenAI-compatible API, which will enhance Ultra's development and testing workflows by providing local LLM alternatives that don't require external API keys or internet access.

## Status

- **Current Phase**: Completed
- **Progress**: 100%
- **Owner**: DevOps Team
- **Started**: 2025-05-02
- **Completed**: 2025-05-02
- **Authority**: Standard Plan
- **Current Status**: Completed

## Plan Review

### Novelty Verification

This plan addresses a new integration not covered by existing actions. While the DockerComposeSetup action established the containerized environment, this new action specifically adds support for locally-run LLMs through Docker Model Runner, which enhances Ultra's core multi-LLM comparison functionality.

### Impact Assessment

This plan impacts:

- Local development workflow
- Testing methodology
- LLM provider integration system
- Documentation and examples
- Docker Compose configuration

## Objectives

- Integrate Docker Model Runner with Ultra to enable local LLM execution
- Create an adapter for the Ultra backend to communicate with Docker Model Runner
- Update Docker Compose configuration to include Docker Model Runner service
- Ensure transparent usage of Docker Model Runner models alongside cloud LLMs
- Document the integration and provide usage examples
- Create tests for the Docker Model Runner integration

## Background

### Problem Statement

The Ultra platform currently relies on external LLM providers requiring API keys and internet access for development and testing. This creates dependencies on external services, increases costs, and complicates offline development. A local LLM solution would address these issues.

### Current State

The system currently:

- Uses mock LLM services for testing with fixed responses
- Requires external API keys for real LLM functionality
- Has adapters for cloud LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
- Uses Docker Compose for development environment

### Desired Future State

The system will:

- Support running open-source LLMs locally via Docker Model Runner
- Allow seamless switching between local and cloud LLMs
- Provide consistent response formats across all LLM sources
- Enable offline development and testing with realistic LLM responses
- Maintain existing cloud LLM functionality

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Setup and Exploration

1. **Install and Configure Docker Model Runner**

   - Install Docker Model Runner plugin in Docker Desktop
   - Test the plugin functionality with simple prompts
   - Document installation requirements and configuration
   - **Task Owner**: DevOps Engineer

2. **Pull and Test Models**
   - Identify suitable open-source models for integration
   - Test models for quality and performance characteristics
   - Document model capabilities and limitations
   - **Task Owner**: LLM Integration Specialist

### Phase 2: Core Integration

1. **Create Docker Model Runner Service**

   - Add Docker Model Runner service to docker-compose.yml
   - Configure service with appropriate settings and ports
   - Ensure proper networking with Ultra backend
   - **Task Owner**: DevOps Engineer

2. **Develop Backend Adapter**
   - Create a Docker Model Runner adapter in the backend service
   - Implement OpenAI-compatible API calls to Docker Model Runner
   - Standardize response formats to match other LLM providers
   - **Task Owner**: Backend Developer

### Phase 3: Configuration and Testing

1. **Update Environment Configuration**

   - Add Docker Model Runner settings to env.example
   - Create feature flags for Docker Model Runner
   - Document new configuration options
   - **Task Owner**: Backend Developer

2. **Testing and Validation**
   - Create unit tests for Docker Model Runner adapter
   - Test integration with Ultra comparison features
   - Perform performance benchmarking
   - **Task Owner**: QA/Developer

### Phase 4: Documentation and Finalization

1. **Create User Documentation**

   - Document Docker Model Runner setup and usage
   - Add examples of using local models in Ultra
   - Update configuration documentation
   - **Task Owner**: Documentation Specialist

2. **Create Migration/Integration Guide**
   - Document how to add new models
   - Create troubleshooting guide
   - Update developer documentation
   - **Task Owner**: Documentation Specialist

## Success Criteria

1. Docker Model Runner models can be used within Ultra like any other LLM provider
2. Environment can switch between local and cloud LLMs seamlessly
3. Response quality and formatting is consistent across providers
4. Setup process is well-documented and reproducible
5. All tests pass when using Docker Model Runner models
6. Ultra works offline using only local models
