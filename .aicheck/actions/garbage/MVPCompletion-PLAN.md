# MVPCompletion Action Plan

## Status

- **Current Status:** ActiveAction
- **Progress:** 0%
- **Last Updated:** 2025-04-29

## Objective

Finalize the Ultra MVP to provide a functioning system that allows users to connect to multiple LLMs, conduct queries, and observe differences in analyses between models.

## Background

The Ultra system has been developed with multiple components including LLM integration, API endpoints, and frontend UI. While much of the foundational work has been completed, we need to ensure that the core functionality works end-to-end. The focus is on delivering a barebones but functional MVP that demonstrates the core value proposition of comparing responses from different LLMs.

## Steps

1. **Verify LLM Integration**

   - [ ] Confirm all LLM API clients are functioning
   - [ ] Test connection to OpenAI (GPT), Anthropic (Claude), and Google (Gemini) APIs
   - [ ] Ensure local model support (Ollama) is working
   - [ ] Validate API key management

2. **Implement Core Comparison Flow**

   - [ ] Finalize the `/api/analyze` endpoint implementation
   - [ ] Ensure orchestrator properly routes requests to selected models
   - [ ] Implement proper error handling and fallbacks
   - [ ] Test parallel processing of requests to multiple LLMs

3. **Complete Frontend Integration**

   - [ ] Connect model selection UI to API
   - [ ] Implement result comparison view with proper formatting
   - [ ] Add loading states and error handling
   - [ ] Test responsive design for various screen sizes

4. **Configuration and Environment Setup**

   - [ ] Create sample environment configuration
   - [ ] Document required API keys
   - [ ] Create setup guide for local development
   - [ ] Add deployment instructions for basic hosting

5. **End-to-End Testing**

   - [ ] Test full request flow from UI to API to LLMs and back
   - [ ] Validate error scenarios and recovery
   - [ ] Test performance with multiple concurrent requests
   - [ ] Verify caching mechanism works properly

6. **Documentation Updates**
   - [ ] Create user guide for basic functionality
   - [ ] Document available API endpoints
   - [ ] Add examples of common usage patterns
   - [ ] Update README with quick start guide

## Success Criteria

- MVP can connect to at least 3 different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- Users can select which models to use for comparison
- Users can submit prompts and receive comparative analysis
- UI clearly displays differences between model responses
- System handles errors gracefully
- Documentation allows new users to understand and use the system

## Technical Requirements

- Use existing components where possible
- Focus on the core functionality, not additional features
- Ensure proper error handling throughout
- Maintain responsive design principles
- Implement proper logging for debugging

## Dependencies

- UltraLLMIntegration (Completed)
- APIIntegration (Completed)
- UIPrototypeIntegration (Completed)

## Timeline

- Start: 2025-04-29
- Target Completion: 2025-05-06
- Estimated Duration: 7 days

## Notes

This action focuses on delivering core functionality:

- LLM connection and querying
- Comparison of analyses between models
- Simple but effective UI

It deliberately excludes:

- Money transactional info
- User profiles
- Document attachment capabilities

The goal is a minimally viable but functional product that demonstrates the core value proposition.
