### Remaining

üìù **End-to-End Testing**

- Integration testing with actual API calls
- Performance testing and optimization
- Error handling and recovery testing

üìù **Documentation Updates**

- Complete user guide
- Finalize API documentation
- Update setup instructions

## Implementation Details

The MVP implementation focuses on:

1. **Backend**:
   - FastAPI-based RESTful API
   - Mock LLM responses for testing
   - Memory caching for improved performance

2. **Frontend**:
   - React components for model selection and results display
   - Responsive design for various screen sizes
   - Clear visualization of model comparisons

3. **Integration**:
   - Standardized response format for all LLM providers
   - Parallel processing of requests to multiple LLMs
   - Error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Next Steps

1. Complete the core LLM integration components
2. Finalize the frontend UI implementation
3. Test the full flow with actual API keys
4. Update documentation with final instructions

## Dependencies

- UltraLLMIntegration (Completed)
- APIIntegration (Completed)
- UIPrototypeIntegration (Completed)
