# MVPCompletion Action Plan

## Status: Not Started (0%)

## Goal

Complete a functional MVP that enables users to compare responses from multiple LLM providers, with all LLM integrations working properly and analysis capabilities functional.

## Value to Project

This action delivers the core functionality of Ultra: comparing multiple LLM responses to the same prompt. Completing this action will:

1. Provide a working product that demonstrates the key value proposition
2. Allow users to evaluate responses from different LLM providers
3. Enable basic analysis of LLM outputs

## Overview

Based on the code audit, the individual LLM adapters are mostly implemented, but the end-to-end process needs completion to make the MVP fully functional. This plan focuses on ensuring all LLM integrations work and the analysis process completes successfully.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Verify and Fix LLM Integrations

- Test each LLM adapter (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, Docker Model Runner)
- Fix any authentication or connection issues
- Ensure consistent error handling across all providers
- Verify proper streaming support where applicable

### 2. Complete Analysis Endpoint

- Finalize `/api/analyze` endpoint implementation
- Ensure it properly routes requests to all LLM providers
- Implement basic response processing and comparison
- Add minimal error handling for failed requests

### 3. Connect Frontend to Backend

- Complete model selection UI in SimpleAnalysis page
- Implement prompt input and submission
- Create basic results display that shows all model outputs
- Add minimal loading indicators and error messages

### 4. Verify End-to-End Functionality

- Test complete flow from prompt entry to results display
- Verify all supported LLM providers return results
- Test with Docker Model Runner for local models
- Ensure basic error states are handled

## Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered complete when:

1. Users can select from multiple LLM providers
2. All LLM integrations (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, and Docker Model Runner) successfully return responses
3. Results from multiple models can be viewed in the UI
4. The complete process works end-to-end without errors

## Key Files to Modify

### Backend

- `backend/routes/analyze_routes.py`: Complete the analyze endpoint
- `backend/services/llm_config_service.py`: Ensure all providers are configured
- `src/models/*.py`: Fix any issues with LLM adapters

### Frontend

- `frontend/src/pages/SimpleAnalysis.tsx`: Complete the analysis UI
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts`: Finalize API integration

## Timeline

Estimated time to completion: 3-5 days
