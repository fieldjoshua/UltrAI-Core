# Migration Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for migrating the UltraAI codebase to the new directory structure. It provides a phased approach that minimizes disruption while ensuring a clean, well-organized result.

## Migration Principles

1. **Incremental Changes**: Migrate code in small, manageable increments rather than all at once
2. **Continuous Testing**: Maintain test coverage throughout migration to catch issues early
3. **Path Compatibility**: Ensure imports and references work during transition
4. **Clear Communication**: Keep all team members informed of structure changes
5. **Documentation First**: Update documentation before code changes

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Preparation (Days 1-3)

1. **Directory Analysis**
   - Complete inventory of all directories and their contents
   - Document all dependencies between directories
   - Create dependency graph to identify critical paths

2. **Test Environment Setup**
   - Create isolated test environment for migration testing
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline for validating migrations
   - Establish baseline test success criteria

3. **Migration Roadmap**
   - Create detailed migration plan for each directory
   - Establish sequence based on dependencies
   - Define success criteria for each migration

### Phase 2: Low-Risk Migrations (Days 4-7)

1. **Independent Directories**
   - Start with directories that have minimal dependencies
   - Examples: benchmarks/, examples/, monitoring/
   - Create target directories in the new structure
   - Move files and update paths
   - Validate functionality

2. **Supporting Libraries**
   - Migrate utility and helper libraries
   - Update import paths in dependent code
   - Deploy temporary compatibility layers if needed

3. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Migrate test code to follow new structure
   - Ensure tests pass with migrated components
   - Update test configurations

### Phase 3: Complex Migrations (Days 8-12)

1. **API Components**
   - Migrate mock-api/ to src/api/mocks
   - Migrate public_api/ to src/api/public
   - Update all references to API paths
   - Test API functionality thoroughly

2. **Cloud Components**
   - Migrate cloud_frontend/ to frontend/cloud
   - Migrate cloud_backend/ to backend/cloud
   - Test cloud functionality end-to-end

3. **Core Infrastructure**
   - Migrate deployment/ to src/deployment
   - Migrate config/ to src/config
   - Update build scripts to work with new paths

### Phase 4: Documentation and Finalization (Days 13-14)

1. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update all code references in documentation
   - Create clear guides for the new structure
   - Document migration decisions and rationale

2. **Build System Adjustments**
   - Update all build scripts to use new paths
   - Remove temporary compatibility layers
   - Optimize build process for new structure

3. **Final Validation**
   - Run full test suite across all components
   - Perform manual validation of key functions
   - Deploy to test environment for full system testing

## Migration Strategy by Directory

| Directory | Migration Approach | Compatibility Strategy | Testing Approach | Timeline |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|------------------|----------|

| cloud_frontend/ | Move to frontend/cloud, update imports | Path forwarding | UI tests | Day 10-11 |
| cloud_backend/ | Move to backend/cloud, update imports | Path forwarding | Service tests | Day 10-11 |
| mock-api/ | Move to src/api/mocks, update imports | Path aliases | Mock API tests | Day 8-9 |
| test_frontend/ | Move to tests/frontend, update paths | None needed | Run existing tests | Day 6-7 |
| cypress/ | Move to tests/e2e, update config | Update config only | Run E2E tests | Day 6-7 |
| benchmarks/ | Move to tests/performance, update scripts | None needed | Run benchmark tests | Day 4-5 |
| examples/ | Move to src/examples, update references | None needed | Verify examples work | Day 4-5 |
| data/ | Move to src/data, update imports | Path forwarding | Data access tests | Day 8-9 |
| deployment/ | Move to src/deployment, update scripts | Path aliases | Deployment tests | Day 11-12 |
| monitoring/ | Move to src/monitoring, update imports | None needed | Basic functionality | Day 4-5 |
| config/ | Move to src/config, update imports | Path forwarding | Configuration tests | Day 11-12 |
| docs/ | Analyze and distribute to actions | N/A | Manual review | Day 4-7 |
| NEWArchive/ | Review contents and archive | N/A | None needed | Day 6-7 |

## Path Compatibility Strategies

### Path Forwarding

For directories with many external dependencies, implement temporary forwarding:

```javascript
// In old location (e.g., cloud_frontend/index.js)
export * from '../frontend/cloud/index.js';
```

### Path Aliases

Update build configuration to temporarily support both old and new paths:

```javascript
// In webpack.config.js or similar
resolve: {
  alias: {
    'public_api': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/api/public'),
    // other aliases
  }
}
```

### Import Updates

For smaller changes, directly update all imports:

```javascript
// Before
import { api } from 'mock-api/client';

// After
import { api } from 'src/api/mocks/client';
```

## Handling Unclassified Content

During migration, some files and directories may not have a clear place in the new structure. For these cases:

1. **Temporary Classification Process**
   - Move the content to `Actions/CODEBASE_REORGANIZATION/UNCLASSIFIED/`
   - Create a subdirectory named after the original location
   - Include a README.md with context about the content
   - Document any known dependencies or usage

2. **Analysis Requirements**
   - Conduct code analysis to determine purpose and relationships
   - Consult with relevant stakeholders about the content's purpose
   - Document findings in the README.md file

3. **Resolution Options**
   - Assign to an existing action and migrate to appropriate directory
   - Create a new action if the content represents a distinct functional area
   - Archive if determined to be obsolete or unused
   - Refactor if the content should be split across multiple actions

All unclassified content should be resolved before completing the Codebase Reorganization action, with no content remaining in the UNCLASSIFIED directory.

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Rollback Plan**
   - Maintain backup of original structure
   - Create fast rollback procedure for critical issues
   - Document decision points for rollback triggers

2. **Staged Deployments**
   - Deploy changes to development environment first
   - Progress to staging only after validation
   - Monitor closely during initial production deployment

3. **Team Coordination**
   - Freeze non-essential code changes during migration
   - Provide daily updates on migration progress
   - Create clear guidelines for new development during transition

## Success Metrics

1. **Test Coverage**: Maintain or improve test pass rate
2. **Build Success**: All builds complete successfully with new structure
3. **Deployment Success**: All deployments work as expected
4. **Developer Feedback**: Team understands and approves the new structure
5. **Documentation Alignment**: All documentation correctly references new structure

## Communication Plan

1. **Daily Updates**: Provide daily migration status updates
2. **Migration Dashboard**: Maintain dashboard of progress and issues
3. **Path Reference Guide**: Create guide for oldâ†’new path mapping
4. **Migration Office Hours**: Schedule time for migration questions
