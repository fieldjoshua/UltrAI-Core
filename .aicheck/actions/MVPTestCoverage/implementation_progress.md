# MVPTestCoverage Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Test Planning and Prioritization ✅
- [x] Identified critical user flows for the MVP
- [x] Created test plan focusing on high-value tests
- [x] Set up basic testing infrastructure and fixtures

## Phase 2: Core API Testing 🔄
- [x] Created comprehensive test for analyze endpoint (test_analyze_endpoint.py)
- [x] Created comprehensive test for available models endpoint (test_available_models_endpoint.py)
- [x] Created comprehensive test for LLM request endpoint (test_llm_request_endpoint.py)
- [x] Created comprehensive test for health endpoint (test_health_endpoint.py)
- [x] Updated conftest.py with shared fixtures and mock data
- [x] Created pytest.ini configuration 
- [x] Created test runner script (run_tests.sh)
- [ ] Test API authentication endpoints
- [ ] Test rate limiting functionality 

## Phase 3: End-to-End Flow Testing 🔄
- [ ] Implement end-to-end tests for document analysis flow
- [ ] Test integration between frontend and backend
- [ ] Implement basic CI pipeline integration

## Critical User Flows Coverage

| User Flow | API Tests | Integration Tests | Status |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Document Analysis | ✅ | 🔄 | In Progress |
| Available Models | ✅ | N/A | Complete |
| LLM Request | ✅ | N/A | Complete |
| Health Check | ✅ | N/A | Complete |
| User Authentication | 🔄 | ❌ | Not Started |
| Rate Limiting | 🔄 | N/A | In Progress |

## Progress Summary

### Completed
- Created comprehensive tests for critical API endpoints (health, analyze, available-models, llm-request)
- Updated testing infrastructure with shared fixtures and test configurations
- Created a test runner script to execute tests in the proper order

### In Progress
- Testing authentication and rate limiting functionality
- End-to-end testing for document analysis flow

### Next Steps
1. Complete tests for remaining API endpoints
2. Implement basic end-to-end tests for the document analysis flow
3. Set up basic CI pipeline integration

## Current Test Coverage

API endpoint test coverage: 4/6 critical endpoints (67%)
Core functionality coverage: 4/5 critical flows (80%)
