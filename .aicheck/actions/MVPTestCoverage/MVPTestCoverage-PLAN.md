# MVPTestCoverage Action Plan

## Overview

This action plan focuses on implementing targeted test coverage for critical MVP paths to ensure core functionality works reliably. Rather than attempting to achieve comprehensive test coverage, this plan takes a pragmatic approach by focusing on the most critical user flows that must work properly for the MVP launch.

## Objectives

1. Identify critical user flows that must be tested for MVP release
2. Implement high-value tests focusing on end-to-end functionality
3. Create automated tests for the core LLM integration features
4. Ensure basic error handling is tested for primary user flows
5. Establish a minimal CI testing pipeline to catch regressions

## Success Criteria

1. Critical user flows have automated tests with >80% coverage
2. All API endpoints used in the MVP front end have functional tests
3. Basic LLM integration has tests with mock responses
4. Error conditions for critical flows are tested
5. CI pipeline runs tests automatically on pull requests

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Test Planning and Prioritization - Days 1-2
- Identify and document critical user flows for the MVP
- Create a test plan focusing on high-value tests
- Set up basic testing infrastructure and fixtures

### Phase 2: Core API Testing - Days 3-5
- Implement tests for critical API endpoints
- Create mock responses for external services
- Test basic error handling scenarios

### Phase 3: End-to-End Flow Testing - Days 6-7
- Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Test integration between frontend and backend
- Implement basic CI pipeline integration

## Implementation Details

### Critical User Flows

The following flows have been identified as critical for the MVP:

1. **Document Analysis Flow**
   - Document upload
   - Analysis request
   - LLM processing
   - Results retrieval and display

2. **User Authentication Flow**
   - User registration (if in MVP)
   - Login/logout
   - Session management

3. **Analysis Configuration Flow**
   - Selecting LLM models
   - Setting analysis parameters
   - Saving and loading configurations

### Testing Approach

For the MVP, we will focus on:

1. **API Tests**: Using FastAPI TestClient to test critical endpoints
2. **Mock-based Tests**: Using response mocks for external LLM services
3. **Basic Frontend Tests**: Simple component tests for critical UI elements
4. **Integration Tests**: A small set of end-to-end tests covering the main user journey

### Test Implementation Strategy

To maximize efficiency, tests will be implemented in this order:

1. Critical API endpoint tests (highest priority)
2. LLM integration tests with mocks (high priority)
3. End-to-end flow tests of main user journey (medium priority)
4. Component tests for key UI elements (medium priority)
5. Error handling tests (medium priority)

### CI Pipeline Integration

A basic CI pipeline will be implemented that:
1. Runs tests on pull requests
2. Generates coverage reports
3. Blocks merging if critical tests fail

## Dependencies

This action depends on:
- Clear understanding of the MVP feature set
- Stable API design for core endpoints
- Mock responses for external service calls

## Resources Required

- Access to application code and architecture documentation
- Example request/response pairs for all critical endpoints
- Sample data for testing document analysis

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Insufficient time to test all critical paths | Medium | High | Prioritize based on user impact |
| External service changes breaking mocks | Medium | Medium | Use defensive mocking patterns |
| Flaky tests in CI pipeline | Medium | Medium | Build retry logic and isolation |
| Over-testing non-critical features | Low | Medium | Maintain strict focus on MVP features |

## MVP Prioritization

For the MVP release, we are intentionally limiting scope to ensure delivery:

- Focus only on critical user flows
- Use mocks extensively to avoid external dependencies
- Implement minimal CI integration
- Skip comprehensive coverage in favor of testing key functionality

## Post-MVP Test Roadmap

After the MVP release, testing will be expanded to include:
1. Comprehensive API test coverage
2. Extended frontend component testing
3. Performance and load testing
4. Security testing automation
5. Accessibility testing

## Team Members

- Backend Developer - API and integration tests
- Frontend Developer - Component and UI tests
- QA Engineer - End-to-end flow tests
- DevOps - CI pipeline integration

## Communication Plan

- Document all test plans in the supporting_docs directory
- Maintain a list of critical flows and their test status
- Report test coverage metrics weekly during MVP development

## Success Metrics

- Test coverage percentage for critical paths (target: >80%)
- Number of automated tests implemented
- Percentage of API endpoints with tests
- CI pipeline run success rate
