# TODO: orchestration-integration-fix

*This file tracks task progress for the orchestration-integration-fix action. Tasks are managed using Claude Code's native todo functions and should align with the action plan phases and success criteria.*

## Active Tasks

### Phase 1: Backend Connection (Critical)
- [ ] **Fix orchestrator imports** (priority: high, status: pending)
  - Connect backend/routes/orchestrator_routes.py to real ultra_pattern_orchestrator.py
  - Remove stub code and import actual orchestration engine

- [ ] **Add model registry endpoint** (priority: high, status: pending)
  - Return available models from environment
  - Support dynamic model configuration

- [ ] **Add pattern registry endpoint** (priority: high, status: pending)
  - Return available analysis patterns (gut, confidence, critique, fact_check, perspective, scenario)
  - Include pattern descriptions and requirements

- [ ] **Implement 4-stage orchestration endpoint** (priority: high, status: pending)
  - Full Feather analysis pipeline (Initial → Meta → Hyper → Ultra)
  - Progress tracking for each stage

- [ ] **Add quality metrics integration** (priority: high, status: pending)
  - Multi-dimensional scoring system
  - Quality evaluation display in responses

### Phase 2: Frontend Enhancement
- [ ] **Model selection UI** (priority: high, status: pending)
  - Checkboxes for LLM selection
  - Integration with model registry endpoint

- [ ] **Pattern selection UI** (priority: high, status: pending)
  - Dropdown for analysis patterns
  - Pattern descriptions and guidance

- [ ] **4-stage progress display** (priority: high, status: pending)
  - Show orchestration progression visually
  - Real-time updates during analysis

- [ ] **Response visualization** (priority: medium, status: pending)
  - Display all stages with quality scores
  - Individual model response breakdown

- [ ] **Result synthesis display** (priority: medium, status: pending)
  - Final orchestrated output with model attribution
  - Quality metrics and confidence scores

### Phase 3: Integration Testing
- [ ] **End-to-end orchestration testing** (priority: high, status: pending)
  - Full pipeline validation with real API keys
  - All 6 patterns working correctly

- [ ] **Pattern analysis verification** (priority: medium, status: pending)
  - Test each analysis pattern individually
  - Verify quality evaluation works for each

- [ ] **User experience testing** (priority: medium, status: pending)
  - Interface usability validation
  - Patent feature visibility confirmation

## Completed Tasks

*No tasks completed yet*

## Notes

- Action plan reference: `orchestration-integration-fix-plan.md`
- Dependencies: Real API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google
- Progress tracking: Currently 0% - backend integration is blocking everything
- Special considerations: MUST preserve patent-protected sophisticated features
- Critical issue: This is THE priority action that unlocks UltraAI's competitive advantages

## Task Management Guidelines

- This action directly exposes the sophisticated 4-stage Feather orchestration
- Backend connection must be completed before frontend work
- All changes must preserve patent-protected intellectual property
- Focus on exposing sophistication, not hiding it behind "simple" interfaces
