# Middleware Issue Analysis

## Problem
The orchestrator endpoints are returning "No response returned" errors due to a known Starlette middleware issue.

## Root Cause
When using multiple middleware layers with Starlette's BaseHTTPMiddleware, the `call_next` function can timeout or fail to properly handle responses. This is a well-documented issue in the Starlette community.

## Error Details
```
RuntimeError: No response returned.
  File "/backend/utils/monitoring.py", line 124, in request_tracking_middleware
    response = await call_next(request)
```

## Current Middleware Stack (in order)
1. Error handling middleware
2. Security headers middleware  
3. CSRF middleware
4. Validation middleware
5. Auth middleware (when enabled)
6. API key middleware (when enabled)
7. Locale middleware
8. Structured logging middleware
9. Rate limit middleware
10. Monitoring middleware

## Solutions

### Option 1: Reduce Middleware Layers
Remove or combine non-essential middleware.

### Option 2: Convert to Pure ASGI Middleware
Rewrite critical middleware as pure ASGI middleware instead of BaseHTTPMiddleware.

### Option 3: Add Orchestrator to Public Paths
Temporarily bypass authentication for orchestrator endpoints.

### Option 4: Use Direct Response
Skip middleware for specific endpoints by implementing them differently.

## Immediate Workaround
For testing purposes, we can:
1. Add orchestrator endpoints to public paths in API key middleware
2. Disable some middleware temporarily
3. Test with a minimal app configuration

## Long-term Fix
The proper solution is to refactor the middleware stack to use pure ASGI middleware for critical components, avoiding the BaseHTTPMiddleware issues.
