# Deployment Audit Report

## üö® Critical Findings

### 1. Endpoint Mismatch
**Local Code**: Has `/api/orchestrator/models`, `/api/orchestrator/patterns`, `/api/orchestrator/feather`
**Production**: Returns 404 for all orchestrator endpoints
**Available in Prod**: `/api/orchestrator/execute` (different endpoint!)

### 2. Deployment Discrepancies
- Production has `/api/available-models` (returns 6 models)
- Production has `/api/orchestrator/execute` (not in our local code)
- Missing: All the sophisticated orchestrator endpoints we implemented

### 3. Code Version Issues
**Evidence suggests production is running an older version:**
- Different endpoint structure
- Missing pattern-based orchestration
- No 4-stage Feather endpoints

## üîç Required Audits

### 1. Deployment Configuration Audit
- [ ] Check which app file is being deployed (app.py vs app_production.py vs something else)
- [ ] Verify render.yaml or deployment scripts
- [ ] Check if correct branch is deployed
- [ ] Verify build/start commands

### 2. Code Alignment Audit
- [ ] Compare local backend/app.py with what's in production
- [ ] Check if there are multiple app files causing confusion
- [ ] Verify import paths in production environment
- [ ] Check for environment-specific configurations

### 3. Git/Deployment Status
- [ ] Check if latest changes are pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Verify Render is pulling from correct branch
- [ ] Check deployment logs for errors
- [ ] Confirm build succeeded with all dependencies

### 4. Script Audit
- [ ] Review all start scripts (start-backend.sh, start-production.sh, etc.)
- [ ] Check which script Render uses
- [ ] Verify correct entry points
- [ ] Check for hardcoded configurations

## üéØ Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Find the ACTUAL production app file**
2. **Check deployment configuration**
3. **Verify git push status**
4. **Review Render deployment settings**

## üìä Hypothesis

The production deployment appears to be using a different codebase or configuration than what we've been working on locally. This could be due to:
- Wrong branch deployed
- Different app entry point
- Old cached deployment
- Missing git push
