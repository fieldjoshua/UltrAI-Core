# Deployment Status Check

Date: 2025-05-27 23:35 UTC
Test Results: ENDPOINTS NOT UPDATED

## 🔍 Findings

### Production Deployment Status
- **Health**: ✅ Working (server is up)
- **Old endpoint**: ✅ `/api/orchestrator/execute` still exists
- **New endpoints**: ❌ Missing all sophisticated orchestrator endpoints
- **API Keys**: ❌ OpenAI API key not configured

### OpenAPI Spec Check
Production only shows: `/api/orchestrator/execute`
Missing our new endpoints:
- `/api/orchestrator/models`
- `/api/orchestrator/patterns` 
- `/api/orchestrator/feather`

## 🎯 Possible Issues

1. **Deployment Not Updated Yet**
   - Render might still be building/deploying
   - Can take 5-10 minutes sometimes

2. **app_production.py Not Loading**
   - File might not be in correct location
   - Import path might be wrong

3. **Cache Issue**
   - Old deployment might be cached
   - Need manual redeploy trigger

4. **Build Failure**
   - Check Render build logs
   - Dependencies might have failed

## 📋 Next Steps

1. Check Render dashboard for deployment status
2. Look at build/deploy logs
3. Verify app_production.py is in root directory
4. Consider manual redeploy if needed
5. Test again in 5-10 minutes

## ⏰ Timeline
- **23:30**: Pushed changes to GitHub
- **23:35**: Tested - old endpoints still active
- **Status**: Waiting for deployment to complete
