- [ ] Mock mode operates correctly as fallback

#### Security

- [ ] No critical security vulnerabilities identified
- [ ] Authentication tokens properly implemented
- [ ] API keys securely stored and accessed
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse
- [ ] CORS properly configured

#### Performance

- [ ] API response times < 500ms (excluding LLM calls)
- [ ] Frontend loads < 3 seconds
- [ ] System handles 100 concurrent users
- [ ] Memory usage stable under load
- [ ] No memory leaks detected

#### Infrastructure

- [ ] Docker containers build successfully
- [ ] All services start without errors
- [ ] Health checks pass consistently
- [ ] Database migrations complete
- [ ] Monitoring and logging operational

#### Documentation

- [ ] Deployment guide complete and tested
- [ ] API documentation accurate
- [ ] Runbook covers common scenarios
- [ ] Configuration reference available
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide ready

### ðŸ”´ NO-GO Criteria (Any single item triggers NO-GO)

#### Critical Issues

- [ ] Data loss or corruption possible
- [ ] Security vulnerability exposes user data
- [ ] Authentication can be bypassed
- [ ] System crashes under normal load
- [ ] Core features non-functional

#### High-Risk Issues

- [ ] > 3 high-severity bugs unresolved
- [ ] Performance degradation > 50%
- [ ] Missing critical monitoring
- [ ] No rollback procedure
- [ ] Incomplete backup strategy

#### Operational Readiness

- [ ] Team not trained on procedures
- [ ] No incident response plan
- [ ] Missing critical documentation
- [ ] No post-launch support plan
- [ ] Unresolved legal/compliance issues

## Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk Level | Impact | Likelihood | Action Required   |
| ---------- | ------ | ---------- | ----------------- |
| Critical   | High   | High       | NO-GO - Must fix  |
| High       | High   | Medium     | NO-GO - Must fix  |
| High       | Medium | High       | NO-GO - Must fix  |
| Medium     | Medium | Medium     | Fix or mitigate   |
| Low        | Low    | Any        | Track and monitor |

## Launch Readiness Score

### Scoring System

- **100-90**: Excellent - Full GO
- **89-80**: Good - GO with monitoring
- **79-70**: Fair - Conditional GO
- **Below 70**: Poor - NO-GO

### Score Calculation

2. Notify all stakeholders
3. Prepare launch communications
4. Enable enhanced monitoring
5. Brief support team

### If NO-GO

1. Document blocking issues
2. Create remediation plan
3. Set new target date
4. Communicate to stakeholders
5. Schedule follow-up review

### If CONDITIONAL GO

1. Document conditions clearly
2. Assign owners to conditions
3. Set completion deadlines
4. Plan verification steps
5. Schedule condition review
