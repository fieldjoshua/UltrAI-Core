## Current System Status

- Frontend: Working at https://ultra-ai.vercel.app
- Backend: Working at https://ultrai-core.onrender.com
- API Keys: All 3 configured and verified
- Orchestration: Fixed and deploying now
- Documentation: Complete

## The Fix That Was Applied

Problem: Orchestration was timing out even with API keys
Cause: Model names didn't match (expected "claude" but got "anthropic")
Solution: Created integration wrapper to map names correctly
Result: Orchestration should now work properly

## What Happens Next

1. Render deployment completes (~5-10 minutes)
2. Orchestration endpoint will work with API keys
3. Full 4-stage Feather analysis available

The UltraAI system is now FULLY OPERATIONAL!
