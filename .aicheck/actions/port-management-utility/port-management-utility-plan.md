# Port Management Utility - Implementation Plan

## Overview

The Port Management Utility Action is aimed at creating tools for resolving port conflicts in the Ultra development environment. Port conflicts are a recurring issue that requires manual intervention, reducing productivity and causing frustration for developers. This Action will implement automated solutions for port management.

## Objectives

1. Create a port clearing utility script that can automatically detect and kill processes running on specific ports
2. Integrate port clearing into server startup scripts to ensure smooth operation
3. Improve path handling and error recovery in configuration for Docker compatibility
4. Update documentation with port management instructions

## Success Criteria

1. Port conflicts can be automatically resolved without manual intervention
2. Server startup scripts incorporate port clearing for smoother operation
3. Path handling works correctly in both local and Docker environments
4. Directory creation failures gracefully fallback to in-memory alternatives
5. Documentation clearly explains port management procedures

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create Port Clearing Utility**

   - Develop a `clear_port.sh` bash script that can detect and kill processes on a given port
   - Ensure the script can be used both standalone and sourced by other scripts
   - Include verbose output for clarity and error handling

2. **Enhance Configuration Path Handling**

   - Modify `config.py` to properly handle both relative and absolute paths
   - Ensure paths work correctly in both local and Docker environments
   - Implement graceful fallbacks for directory creation failures

3. **Integrate Port Clearing in Scripts**

   - Update `start-dev.sh` to clear port before starting
   - Update `start-ultra-with-modelrunner.sh` to clear port before starting
   - Update `test_production.sh` to include port clearing in cleanup
   - Create a comprehensive port management approach

4. **Create Import Fix Utility**

   - Develop a `fix_imports.py` script to automatically add 'backend.' prefix to imports
   - Use regular expressions for reliability without external dependencies
   - Ensure the script handles different import patterns correctly

5. **Update Documentation**
   - Add port management section to README.md
   - Update local development guide with port conflict resolution steps
   - Document the new utilities and their usage patterns

## Deliverables

1. `scripts/clear_port.sh` - Port clearing utility
2. `scripts/kill_api_ports.sh` - API port management script
3. Updated `config.py` with improved path handling
4. Updated server scripts with port clearing integration
5. `fix_imports.py` - Python import fixer utility
6. Updated documentation with port management instructions

## Dependencies

- Access to shell commands like `lsof` and `kill`
- Permission to modify server startup scripts
- Understanding of Docker environment constraints

## Resource Requirements

- Development environment with access to shell utilities
- Testing environment to verify port management works correctly

## Timeline

- Port clearing utility development: 1 day
- Path handling enhancements: 1 day
- Script integration: 1 day
- Documentation updates: 1 day
- Testing and refinement: 1 day

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk                                             | Probability | Impact | Mitigation                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Port clearing fails on some platforms            | Medium      | Medium | Implement fallback mechanisms and clear error messages  |
| Docker environment differences cause path issues | Medium      | High   | Extensive testing in both local and Docker environments |
| Script permissions issues                        | Low         | Medium | Document proper permission settings in documentation    |

## Dependencies on Other Actions

- Builds on `DockerComposeSetup` for Docker environment understanding
- Enhances `MVPTestCoverage` by making tests more reliable

## Impact on Future Actions

- Will improve `MVPDeploymentPipeline` by ensuring consistent port behavior
- Will enhance developer experience for all future actions

## Documentation

Documentation with enduring value will be migrated to:

- `/documentation/technical/setup/port_management.md`
- Port management section in README.md
- Port conflict resolution in local development guide
