## Notes

- This action directly addresses the orchestration-integration-fix deployment failure
- Focus on backward compatibility - everything must continue working
- Claude's native todo functionality must be preserved and enhanced
- Deployment verification is the critical new capability
- Consider creating a `aicheck doctor` command to diagnose issues

## Success Criteria Tracking

- [ ] Single action.yaml contains consolidated information
- [ ] CLI tools automate common workflows  
- [ ] Deployment verification enforced programmatically
- [ ] All indexes update automatically
- [ ] Issue tracking integrated with actions
- [ ] Dependency management automated
- [ ] Git hooks prevent incomplete actions
- [ ] Smooth migration path for existing actions

## Dependencies

- Existing aicheck bash script
- Git hooks infrastructure  
- Claude's TodoRead/TodoWrite functions
- YAML parsing capability (yq or similar)
