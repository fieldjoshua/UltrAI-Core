# Expert Ultras™ - Knowledge-Enhanced Ultra Synthesis

## Concept Overview

Expert Ultras would be specialized versions of the Ultra Synthesis™ pipeline that incorporate domain-specific knowledge bases to provide expert-level synthesis in particular fields. This would be implemented as a backend enhancement to the orchestration service.

## Architecture Design

### 1. Knowledge Base Integration Layer

```python
class KnowledgeBaseManager:
    """
    Manages domain-specific knowledge bases for Expert Ultras.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.knowledge_bases = {
            "medical": MedicalKnowledgeBase(),
            "legal": LegalKnowledgeBase(),
            "financial": FinancialKnowledgeBase(),
            "engineering": EngineeringKnowledgeBase(),
            "scientific": ScientificKnowledgeBase(),
            # More domains...
        }
    
    async def enhance_context(self, query: str, domain: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Enhance query context with relevant knowledge base information.
        """
        if domain not in self.knowledge_bases:
            return {}
        
        kb = self.knowledge_bases[domain]
        
        # Extract relevant facts, regulations, best practices
        relevant_knowledge = await kb.query(query)
        
        # Get domain-specific constraints
        constraints = await kb.get_constraints(query)
        
        # Get recent updates in the field
        recent_updates = await kb.get_recent_updates()
        
        return {
            "facts": relevant_knowledge,
            "constraints": constraints,
            "recent_developments": recent_updates,
            "confidence_modifiers": kb.get_confidence_modifiers()
        }
```

### 2. Expert Ultra Pipeline Enhancement

```python
class ExpertOrchestrationService(OrchestrationService):
    """
    Enhanced orchestration service with expert knowledge integration.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.knowledge_manager = KnowledgeBaseManager()
        
    async def run_expert_pipeline(
        self,
        input_data: Any,
        domain: str,
        options: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,
        selected_models: Optional[List[str]] = None,
    ) -> Dict[str, PipelineResult]:
        """
        Run expert pipeline with knowledge base enhancement.
        """
        # 1. Enhance context with domain knowledge
        knowledge_context = await self.knowledge_manager.enhance_context(
            input_data, domain
        )
        
        # 2. Create enhanced prompt with knowledge context
        enhanced_prompt = self._create_expert_prompt(
            input_data, 
            knowledge_context,
            domain
        )
        
        # 3. Run standard pipeline with enhanced prompt
        results = await self.run_pipeline(
            enhanced_prompt,
            options,
            selected_models=selected_models
        )
        
        # 4. Validate results against knowledge base
        validated_results = await self._validate_against_knowledge(
            results,
            knowledge_context,
            domain
        )
        
        return validated_results
```

### 3. Domain-Specific Knowledge Bases

```python
class MedicalKnowledgeBase:
    """
    Medical domain knowledge base with clinical guidelines, drug interactions, etc.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.clinical_guidelines = self._load_guidelines()
        self.drug_database = self._load_drug_database()
        self.condition_protocols = self._load_protocols()
        
    async def query(self, query: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Search for relevant medical information
        conditions = await self._extract_conditions(query)
        medications = await self._extract_medications(query)
        
        relevant_info = {
            "guidelines": [],
            "contraindications": [],
            "standard_protocols": [],
            "risk_factors": []
        }
        
        # Get relevant clinical guidelines
        for condition in conditions:
            relevant_info["guidelines"].extend(
                self.clinical_guidelines.get(condition, [])
            )
            
        # Check drug interactions
        if len(medications) > 1:
            interactions = await self._check_interactions(medications)
            relevant_info["contraindications"].extend(interactions)
            
        return relevant_info
```

## Implementation Approach

2. Create knowledge base manager interface
3. Implement knowledge retrieval and querying

### Phase 2: Domain-Specific Knowledge Bases
1. Start with 2-3 high-value domains (medical, legal, financial)
2. Create knowledge ingestion pipelines
3. Implement domain-specific validation rules

### Phase 3: Pipeline Integration
1. Enhance orchestration service with knowledge context
2. Create expert prompt templates
3. Implement result validation against knowledge base

### Phase 4: API and Frontend Integration

1. Retrieve relevant regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
2. Include recent case law and precedents
3. Check jurisdiction-specific requirements
4. Provide compliance checklist with legal citations
```

### Financial Expert Ultra
```
Query: "What's the best strategy for portfolio diversification in a high-inflation environment?"

Expert Ultra would:
1. Retrieve historical inflation hedge performance data
2. Include current market conditions
3. Check regulatory constraints (if applicable)
4. Provide risk-adjusted recommendations with data backing
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Knowledge Base Storage Options

**Option A: Vector Database (Recommended)**
- Use Pinecone, Weaviate, or Qdrant
- Store embeddings of knowledge chunks
- Enable semantic search
- Scale to millions of documents

**Option B: Graph Database**
- Use Neo4j for relationship-heavy domains
- Better for interconnected knowledge
- Good for medical/legal relationships

**Option C: Hybrid Approach**
- Vector DB for search
- Graph DB for relationships
- Traditional DB for structured data

### 2. Knowledge Ingestion Pipeline

```python
class KnowledgeIngestionPipeline:
    """
    Pipeline for ingesting and processing domain knowledge.
    """
    async def ingest_document(self, document: Document, domain: str):
        # 1. Parse and extract structured information
        extracted_data = await self.extract_information(document)
        
        # 2. Generate embeddings for semantic search
        embeddings = await self.generate_embeddings(extracted_data)
        
        # 3. Extract relationships and entities
        entities = await self.extract_entities(extracted_data)
        relationships = await self.extract_relationships(entities)
        
        # 4. Store in appropriate databases
        await self.vector_db.store(embeddings)
        await self.graph_db.store(entities, relationships)
        
        # 5. Update domain-specific indices
        await self.update_indices(domain, extracted_data)
```

### 3. Confidence Scoring with Knowledge Base

```python
def calculate_expert_confidence(
    synthesis_result: str,
    knowledge_context: Dict[str, Any],
    domain: str
) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """
    Calculate confidence scores based on knowledge base alignment.
    """
    scores = {
        "factual_accuracy": 0.0,
        "guideline_compliance": 0.0,
        "completeness": 0.0,
        "currency": 0.0  # How current is the information
    }
    
    # Check facts against knowledge base
    fact_checker = FactChecker(knowledge_context)
    scores["factual_accuracy"] = fact_checker.verify(synthesis_result)
    
    # Check compliance with domain guidelines
    if "guidelines" in knowledge_context:
        scores["guideline_compliance"] = check_guideline_compliance(
            synthesis_result,
            knowledge_context["guidelines"]
        )
    
    # Check completeness
    required_elements = get_required_elements(domain, knowledge_context)
    scores["completeness"] = check_completeness(
        synthesis_result,
        required_elements
    )
    
    # Check currency of information
    scores["currency"] = assess_information_currency(
        synthesis_result,
        knowledge_context.get("recent_developments", [])
    )
    
    return scores
```
