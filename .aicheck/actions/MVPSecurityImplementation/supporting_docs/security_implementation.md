# Security Implementation Guide

This document provides an overview of the security measures implemented in the Ultra backend. It covers authentication, API protection, and security best practices.

## Authentication System

The authentication system is implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with the following components:

### 1. JWT Authentication

- **Token Generation**: Tokens are generated using strong cryptographic methods
- **Token Validation**: Tokens are validated for integrity and expiration
- **Refresh Tokens**: Long-lived refresh tokens for session persistence
- **Token Blacklisting**: Invalidating tokens on logout

### 2. Authentication Middleware

The `AuthMiddleware` class handles authentication:

- Validates JWT tokens in requests
- Adds user context to request state
- Handles token expiration and renewal
- Provides clear error messages for auth failures

### 3. Password Security

- Strong password hashing using PBKDF2 with high iteration count
- Password strength validation during registration and reset
- Secure password reset flow with tokenization

## API Protection

### 1. API Key Management

The `ApiKeyManager` provides:

- Secure API key generation
- Scope-based access control (read-only, read-write, admin)
- Path-specific permissions
- Rate limiting per key
- IP address restrictions
- Key rotation capabilities

### 2. API Key Middleware

The `ApiKeyMiddleware` authenticates API requests:

- Validates API keys on protected endpoints
- Enforces scope-based access control
- Logs API key usage for auditing
- Provides graceful error handling

## Security Headers

The `SecurityHeadersMiddleware` adds security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities:

- **Content-Security-Policy**: Prevents XSS attacks
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME-sniffing
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Enables browser XSS filtering
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts browser features

## CSRF Protection

The `CSRFMiddleware` protects against Cross-Site Request Forgery:

- Token-based validation for state-changing requests
- Double-submit cookie pattern
- Automatic token generation and verification
- Protection for all state-changing methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)

## Input Validation

The `ValidationMiddleware` provides advanced input validation:

- Protection against common injection attacks (SQL, XSS, Command)
- Request body size limits
- JSON structure validation
- Input sanitization
- Path traversal protection

## Rate Limiting

Rate limiting protects against abuse and DDoS attacks:

- IP-based rate limiting
- User-based rate limiting
- Path-specific rate limits
- Tiered rate limits based on subscription level
- Exponential backoff for abusive clients

## Error Handling

Secure error handling prevents information leakage:

- Generic error messages for clients
- Detailed internal logging
- Structured error responses
- Prevention of stack trace exposure

## Middleware Configuration

The security middleware is configured in `app.py` in the following order:

1. Error handling middleware
2. Security headers middleware
3. CSRF middleware
4. Validation middleware
5. Authentication middleware
6. API key middleware
7. Rate limiting middleware

This ensures that security checks are performed in the appropriate order, with basic validation and protection happening before authentication and authorization.

## Security Best Practices

The implementation follows these security best practices:

- Defense in depth (multiple layers of security)
- Principle of least privilege
- Secure by default configuration
- Consistent error handling
- Comprehensive logging and auditing
- Input validation at all entry points
- Output encoding to prevent XSS
- Secure secret management
- Contextual authentication and authorization

## Future Enhancements

Potential future security enhancements include:

- Two-factor authentication
- OAuth 2.0 integration
- More advanced rate limiting
- Web Application Firewall integration
- Advanced threat detection
- Automated security scanning
- Enhanced logging and monitoring
