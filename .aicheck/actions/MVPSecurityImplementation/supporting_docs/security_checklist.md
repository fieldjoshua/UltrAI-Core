## API Protection

- [x] **API Key Management**
  - [x] Generate secure API keys with proper entropy
  - [x] Implement scoped access (read, write, admin)
  - [x] Support path-specific permissions
  - [x] Encrypt keys in storage
  - [x] Implement key rotation

- [x] **API Key Middleware**
  - [x] Validate API keys on protected endpoints

- [x] **Input Validation**
  - [x] Implement validation middleware
  - [x] Protect against SQL injection
  - [x] Protect against XSS attacks
  - [x] Protect against command injection
  - [x] Validate request structure and size

## Web Security

- [x] **Security Headers**
  - [x] Content-Security-Policy
  - [x] Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
  - [x] X-Frame-Options (clickjacking protection)
  - [x] X-Content-Type-Options (MIME-sniffing protection)
  - [x] X-XSS-Protection
  - [x] Referrer-Policy
  - [x] Permissions-Policy

- [x] **CSRF Protection**
  - [x] Implement token-based CSRF protection
  - [x] Validate tokens for state-changing operations
  - [x] Use double-submit cookie pattern
  - [x] Exempt paths that don't need protection
