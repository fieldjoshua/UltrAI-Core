# MVPSecurityImplementation Action Plan (2 of 16)

## Overview

**Status:** Planning  
**Created:** 2025-05-11  
**Last Updated:** 2025-05-11  
**Expected Completion:** 2025-05-18  

## Objective

Implement essential security measures for the Ultra MVP to protect user data, API access, and system integrity without introducing unnecessary complexity or overhead.

## Value to Program

This action directly addresses critical security requirements for the MVP by:

1. Protecting API endpoints from unauthorized access
2. Implementing a simple but effective authentication system
3. Ensuring user data and API keys remain secure
4. Preventing common security vulnerabilities
5. Creating a foundation for future security enhancements

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Implement API key management and protection mechanisms
- [ ] Create input validation and sanitization for all API endpoints
- [ ] Develop basic rate limiting to prevent abuse
- [ ] Implement secure error handling to prevent information leakage
- [ ] Create a simple authentication system with login/logout functionality
- [ ] Establish session management for authenticated users
- [ ] Document security measures and best practices

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Authentication System (Days 1-2)

1. Implement a simple authentication system with:
   - User registration (if in MVP scope)
   - Login/logout endpoints
   - Password hashing and security
   - JWT token generation and validation
   - Session management

2. Create authentication middleware for API routes
   - Route protection based on authentication
   - JWT verification and extraction
   - User context propagation

3. Implement authentication UI components (coordinate with UIPrototypeIntegration)
   - Login form
   - Logout functionality
   - Session indicator

### Phase 2: API Protection (Days 3-4)

1. Implement API key management:
   - Secure storage of third-party API keys
   - User-specific API key handling
   - Key rotation capabilities

2. Add input validation:
   - Request validation middleware
   - Sanitization of user inputs
   - JSON schema validation

3. Create rate limiting:
   - Per-endpoint rate limits
   - User-based rate limiting
   - IP-based rate limiting for public endpoints

### Phase 3: Security Hardening (Days 5-7)

1. Implement secure error handling:
   - Generic error messages for users
   - Detailed internal logging
   - Prevention of stack trace exposure

2. Add security headers:
   - Content Security Policy
   - XSS protection
   - CSRF protection

3. Create security documentation:
   - Implementation details
   - Best practices
   - Security incident response plan

## Dependencies

- Existing API endpoints in `backend/routes/`
- User interface components from `UIPrototypeIntegration`
- Database models for user storage
- Error handling system from `ErrorHandlingImplementation`

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Authentication complexity delaying MVP | High | Medium | Focus on minimal viable authentication, postpone advanced features |
| Performance impact of security measures | Medium | Low | Optimize critical paths, benchmark performance |
| False positives in security measures | Medium | Medium | Implement appropriate bypass mechanisms for legitimate use cases |
| Incomplete security coverage | High | Medium | Use security checklists, focus on most critical vulnerabilities |

## Technical Specifications

### Authentication System

The authentication system will be built using:
- JWT tokens for stateless authentication
- bcrypt for password hashing
- Redis for token blacklisting (optional)
- Middleware-based route protection

### API Protection

API protection will include:
- Schema-based request validation
- Middleware-based rate limiting
- Environment variable management for API keys
- API key encryption at rest

### Security Headers

Security headers will include:
- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options
- X-XSS-Protection
- Strict-Transport-Security

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow

1. User submits credentials
2. Server validates credentials
3. JWT token is generated with appropriate claims
4. Token is returned to client
5. Client includes token in subsequent requests
6. Server validates token on protected routes

### Rate Limiting Implementation

Rate limiting will be implemented using:
- In-memory cache for request tracking
- User/IP-based throttling
- Configurable limits per endpoint
- Appropriate HTTP 429 responses

### Input Validation

Input validation will use:
- JSON schema validation for request bodies
- Parameter validation for query parameters
- Content-type validation for file uploads
- Sanitization to prevent injection attacks

## Documentation Plan

The following documentation will be created:
- Security implementation details
- Authentication system design
- API protection mechanisms
- Security best practices
- Developer guidelines for security
