**Date**: 2025-05-16
**ACTION**: TaskAgentSystem
**Purpose**: Initial design for task agent system
**Template Used**: N/A - Direct user request
**Prompt Hash**: N/A

## Prompt

"question: can you create agents that you can dispatch to handle certain tasks to increase efficiency?"

## Response

Created a comprehensive plan for a TaskAgentSystem that implements:

1. Task dispatcher for intelligent routing
2. Specialized agents for different task types
3. Agent manager for lifecycle management
4. Priority-based task queue
5. Result aggregator for multi-agent coordination

The system is designed to increase efficiency through:

- Parallel task execution
- Specialized handling for different task types
- Smart routing and fallback mechanisms
- Automatic scaling and resource allocation
- Comprehensive monitoring and self-healing

## Modifications

None - Initial design created from scratch

## Verification

- Followed AICheck documentation-first approach
- Created proper ACTION directory structure
- Aligned with existing system architecture
- Included comprehensive testing requirements
- Added configuration examples and API samples

## Iterations

[Number of attempts: 1]
[Reason for iterations: N/A - First attempt]

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Hierarchical Architecture**: Task Dispatcher → Queue → Agent Manager → Agents
2. **Specialized Agent Types**: Document, Analysis, LLM Routing, Validation, Recovery, Cache, Health
3. **Phased Implementation**: 6-week timeline with 4 main phases
4. **Integration Points**: Leverages existing ErrorHandling, Orchestrator, and Monitoring systems
5. **Scalability Focus**: Designed for 100+ agents with linear scaling
