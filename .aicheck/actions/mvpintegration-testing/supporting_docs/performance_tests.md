# Performance Tests - Load Testing Approach

## Overview

This document outlines the load testing approach for the Ultra MVP integration tests.

## Test Profiles

### Small Load (Development Testing)

- 5 concurrent users
- 60 second duration
- Document size: 1KB

### Medium Load (Standard Testing)

- 20 concurrent users
- 300 second duration
- Document size: 100KB

### Large Load (Stress Testing)

- 50 concurrent users
- 600 second duration
- Document size: 10MB

### Extreme Load (Breaking Point)

- 100 concurrent users
- 1800 second duration
- Document size: 50MB

## Performance Metrics

### Response Time Thresholds

- Authentication: < 200ms
- Analysis submission: < 500ms
- Result retrieval: < 300ms

### Throughput Targets

- 50 concurrent users: 100 requests/second
- 100 concurrent users: 150 requests/second

### Resource Limits

- Memory usage: < 2GB under normal load
- CPU utilization: < 80%

## Load Testing Tools

### Locust

Primary tool for API load testing:

- Simulates realistic user behavior
- Provides real-time metrics
- Supports distributed testing

### k6

Alternative for specific scenarios:

- Developer-friendly scripting
- Cloud integration
- Advanced metrics collection

## Test Scenarios

### Ramp-Up Test

Gradually increase load from 1 to 100 users over 10 minutes

### Sustained Load Test

Maintain 50 users for 1 hour to check for memory leaks

### Spike Test

Sudden increase from 10 to 200 users to test elasticity

### Soak Test

Low load (10 users) for 24 hours to detect slow degradation

## Success Criteria

1. No errors under expected load (50 users)
2. Graceful degradation beyond capacity
3. Automatic recovery after spike
4. Consistent performance over time
