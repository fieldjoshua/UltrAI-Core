# Documentation Migration Checklist

This checklist provides a systematic process for evaluating and migrating documentation from ACTION directories to the main documentation system.

## Pre-Migration Assessment

- [ ] **Document Review**
  - [ ] Identify all documentation files in ACTION directory
  - [ ] Determine which documents have potential enduring value
  - [ ] Evaluate each document against enduring value criteria

- [ ] **Enduring Value Criteria**
  - [ ] Does the document describe system components, architecture, or interfaces?
  - [ ] Does the document provide guidance useful beyond this specific ACTION?
  - [ ] Would a new team member benefit from this document months from now?
  - [ ] Does the document establish patterns, standards, or processes?
  - [ ] Is the document referenced by other enduring documentation?

## Document Preparation

- [ ] **Content Review**
  - [ ] Remove ACTION-specific temporary content
  - [ ] Expand abbreviations or ACTION-specific terminology
  - [ ] Ensure code examples are up-to-date
  - [ ] Verify accuracy of all technical information

- [ ] **Metadata Enhancement**
  - [ ] Add original creation date
  - [ ] Add migration date
  - [ ] Add originating ACTION reference
  - [ ] Add appropriate documentation category tags
  - [ ] Add author/maintainer information

- [ ] **Format Standardization**
  - [ ] Follow Markdown style guidelines
  - [ ] Use consistent heading structure
  - [ ] Ensure code blocks have language specifications
  - [ ] Add table of contents for documents > 1000 words

## Migration Process

- [ ] **Target Location**
  - [ ] Identify appropriate documentation category
  - [ ] Determine specific subdirectory
  - [ ] Verify existence of target directory (create if needed)

- [ ] **File Migration**
  - [ ] Copy document to target location
  - [ ] Update file name if needed for consistency
  - [ ] Verify file permissions

- [ ] **Reference Updates**
  - [ ] Identify all documents that reference this document
  - [ ] Update references to point to new location
  - [ ] Add to documentation index files

- [ ] **Original File Handling**
  - [ ] Add migration notice to original file
  - [ ] OR remove original file if redundant

## Post-Migration Verification

- [ ] **Content Verification**
  - [ ] Verify document displays correctly in new location
  - [ ] Test all internal links
  - [ ] Ensure all images and diagrams are visible

- [ ] **Update Documentation Registry**
  - [ ] Add entry to documentation migration log
  - [ ] Update ACTION completion record with migration notes

- [ ] **Notification**
  - [ ] Notify team of documentation migration
  - [ ] Update any bookmarks or references in team tools
