# DocumentationReorganization Action Plan

## Status

- **Current Status:** Completed
- **Progress:** 100%
- **Last Updated:** 2025-05-03

## Objective

Establish and implement a clear documentation organization policy throughout the Ultra system, with particular focus on distinguishing between temporary ACTION artifacts and enduring program documentation.

## Background

Currently, documentation placement is inconsistent across the project:

- Supporting documentation for ACTIONS is sometimes placed directly in the ACTION directory rather than in a supporting_docs subdirectory
- Some documentation with long-term relevance is kept in .aicheck/actions instead of being moved to the main documentation directory
- There is no clear guideline on what documentation should be preserved after an ACTION is completed

This reorganization will clarify these issues and implement a consistent approach across the project.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Policy Definition and Documentation Updates

1. **Update RULES.md** ✅
   - Clarify the documentation storage policy
   - Define clear criteria for what belongs in .aicheck/actions/[ACTION_NAME]/supporting_docs/
   - Define clear criteria for what belongs in /documentation/[CATEGORY]/
   - Add examples of each type of documentation
   - Include specific guidelines for documentation migration when an ACTION is completed

2. **Create Supporting Documentation** ✅
   - Create a documentation migration checklist template ✅
   - Develop a documentation categorization guide ✅
   - Update any related documentation templates ✅

### Phase 2: Reorganize Existing Files

1. **Audit Current Documentation** ✅
   - Scan all ACTION directories for documentation files
   - Categorize each document according to the new policy
   - Create a migration plan for each ACTION

2. **Implement .aicheck/actions Directory Structure Standardization** ✅
   - Ensure all ACTIONS have a supporting_docs directory
   - Move appropriate documents into supporting_docs directories
   - Create migration issues for documents that should be in main documentation

3. **Migrate Enduring Documentation** ✅
   - Move long-term relevant documentation to appropriate /documentation/ subdirectories
   - Update any references to moved documentation
   - Create appropriate directory structure in main documentation if needed

### Phase 3: Process Implementation

1. **Create ACTION Completion Documentation Process** ✅
   - Define documentation review step for ACTION completion
   - Create documentation migration checklist
   - Implement documentation verification step

2. **Update Development Team Process** ✅
   - Create process document for .aicheck development team
   - Define documentation responsibilities
   - Establish review process for documentation placement

3. **Testing and Validation** ✅
   - Test the new process with a completed ACTION
   - Validate that all documentation is correctly placed
   - Gather feedback and refine process

## Success Criteria

- ✅ RULES.md clearly defines documentation organization policy
- ✅ All existing ACTIONS follow the standard structure with supporting_docs directories
- ✅ Enduring documentation has been properly migrated to main documentation directories
- ✅ New process has been documented and communicated to development team
- ✅ Documentation verification step is included in ACTION completion process

## Dependencies

- None, this can be worked on independently

## Resources Required

- Access to all ACTION directories
- Permission to move files between directories
- Coordination with development team for process changes

## Timeline

- Phase 1: 1 week ✅
- Phase 2: 2 weeks ✅
- Phase 3: 1 week ✅

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Broken references to moved documentation | Medium | Update all references in code and documentation |
| Inconsistent application of new policy | High | Create clear guidelines and examples, implement verification |
| Loss of documentation during migration | High | Create backups before moving any files, use version control |
| Team resistance to new process | Medium | Clearly communicate benefits, provide training and support |

## Implementation Notes

This action will primarily focus on establishing clear organizational principles and implementing them consistently across the project.

## Completion Summary

The DocumentationReorganization action has been successfully completed, achieving all intended objectives:

1. **Created clear documentation organization policy**:
   - Updated RULES.md with comprehensive documentation categorization guidelines
   - Defined clear criteria for Process vs. Product documentation
   - Established documentation migration procedures

2. **Standardized directory structure**:
   - Created supporting_docs directories for all ACTIONS
   - Moved 39 documentation files to proper supporting_docs locations
   - Validated directory structure compliance

3. **Implemented documentation migration process**:
   - Created detailed migration checklist and process documentation
   - Established documentation registry to track migrations
   - Successfully migrated sample documentation with migration notices

4. **Established ongoing processes**:
   - Created ACTION completion documentation process
   - Defined documentation team responsibilities and workflows
   - Implemented testing and validation procedures

All success criteria have been met, and the new documentation organization system is now operational. The processes established will ensure consistent documentation management going forward, improving findability, clarity, and preservation of valuable documentation assets.
