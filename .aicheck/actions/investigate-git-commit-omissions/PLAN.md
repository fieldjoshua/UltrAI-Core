# PLAN: Investigate Git Commit Omissions and Timeline

## Objective

Conduct a comprehensive investigation into when and why certain code changes (notably the full app router and HealthService stub) were not committed to GitHub, identify root causes, and outline preventive measures.

## Scope

- Analyze Git commit history to pinpoint the first occurrence of missing or partial commits.
- Review CI configuration to determine gaps in test execution and commit automation.
- Audit working tree changes to understand why some edits remained unstaged.
- Compile a detailed timeline of events (commit hashes, dates, change descriptions).

## Deliverables

- A supporting document (`investigation-report.md`) with:
  - Chronological timeline of relevant commits and CI changes.
  - Root cause analysis for each omission.
  - Impact assessment on code functionality and deployment.
  - Recommended remediation options and next steps.

## Success Criteria

- All missing changes are accounted for with commit details.
- Clear explanation of process gaps (CI, developer workflow, tooling).
- Actionable recommendations to prevent recurrence.
- Documentation aligns with RULES.md: documentation-first, test-driven verification.
