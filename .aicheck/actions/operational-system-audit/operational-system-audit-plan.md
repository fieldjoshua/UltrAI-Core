Status: Not Started
Progress: 0%

## Purpose

Conduct a comprehensive audit of the UltraAI system to identify all operational issues, understand the current state of recent actions, and create a clear path to make the system fully operational. This audit will examine all unarchived information, recent development efforts, and system configurations to provide a complete picture of what needs to be fixed.

## Requirements

- Access to all project directories and files
- Understanding of recent development efforts and actions
- Analysis of deployment configurations and production setup
- Identification of all operational blockers
- Documentation of findings and recommendations

## Dependencies

- None (this is an audit/assessment action)

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Research

- Examine all recent actions (non-completed) to understand current project state
- Review git history and recent commits to understand development focus
- Analyze project structure and identify any structural issues
- Check for error logs, debugging files, and temporary work

### Phase 2: Design

- Document all operational issues found
- Categorize issues by severity and impact
- Create prioritized fix plan
- Design approach for making system operational

### Phase 3: Implementation

- Create comprehensive audit report
- Document all findings in supporting_docs/
- Create actionable fix recommendations
- Document all discovered dependencies

### Phase 4: Testing

- Verify audit findings are complete
- Validate recommended fixes are actionable
- Ensure documentation is clear and useful

## Success Criteria

- Complete inventory of all operational issues documented
- Clear understanding of recent development efforts and their status
- Prioritized list of fixes needed to make system operational
- Action plan with specific steps to address each operational blocker
- All dependencies properly documented with AICheck
- Clear documentation for team on current system state

## Estimated Timeline

- Research: 1 day
- Design: 0.5 days
- Implementation: 0.5 days
- Testing: 0.5 days
- Total: 2.5 days

## Notes

- Focus on actionable findings that directly impact system operability
- Pay special attention to deployment and production issues
- Consider both frontend and backend operational requirements
- Check for any security or authentication issues blocking operation
- Document everything thoroughly for future reference
