# TODO: System-Wide Cleanup and Audit

**Progress update (June 2024):**

- Document and analyze routes refactored to use `create_router` and dependency injection
- Standardized error handling and logging across routes
- Cache decorator and related imports updated to new locations
- Model registry service implemented with lifecycle management
- Orchestration service updated with quality evaluation and rate limiting
- Next: Complete remaining service layer refactoring, add tests, and update documentation

## Phase 1: Code Removal & Restructuring

- [x] DELETE the rogue service: `app/services/llm_config_service.py`.
- [x] DELETE the stub model: `app/models/llm_adapter.py`.
- [x] RENAME the entry point: `app_production.py` -> `app/main.py`.
- [x] REMOVE duplicate health check implementations
- [x] CLEAN up unused configuration files
- [x] IMPLEMENT hardware acceleration detection in `app/utils/`

## Phase 2: Core Architecture

- [x] CREATE `app/services/model_registry.py` for model management
- [x] CREATE `app/services/orchestration_service.py` for core logic
- [ ] REFACTOR `app/services/prompt_service.py` for template management
- [x] IMPLEMENT multi-layered analysis pipeline:
  - [x] Initial response generation
  - [x] Meta-analysis phase
  - [x] Ultra-synthesis stage
  - [x] Hyper-level analysis
- [x] SET up performance metrics collection

## Phase 3: Service Integration

- [ ] REFACTOR `app/main.py` to properly initialize and inject services
- [ ] REFACTOR `app/app.py` to only handle FastAPI setup and middleware
- [x] REFACTOR health routes to use the `create_router` pattern
- [x] REFACTOR document routes to use the `create_router` pattern
- [x] REFACTOR remaining route files to use the `create_router` pattern
- [x] IMPLEMENT proper dependency injection in all services
- [x] STANDARDIZE error handling across all routes
- [x] UNIFY health check implementation
- [x] IMPLEMENT exponential backoff for API calls

## Phase 4: Testing & Verification

- [ ] ADD missing unit tests
- [ ] IMPLEMENT integration tests
- [ ] ADD end-to-end tests for critical paths
- [ ] VERIFY all functionality works as expected
- [ ] DOCUMENT test coverage
- [ ] TEST hardware acceleration support
- [ ] VERIFY performance metrics collection

## Phase 5: Documentation & Deployment

- [ ] UPDATE API documentation
- [ ] DOCUMENT service interfaces
- [ ] CREATE deployment guide
- [ ] VERIFY deployment configuration
- [ ] TEST production deployment
- [ ] VERIFY patent alignment
- [ ] DOCUMENT performance benchmarks
