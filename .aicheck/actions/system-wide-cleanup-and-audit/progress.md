# System-Wide Cleanup and Audit: Progress

**Last updated:** $(date)

## Completed Tasks

- Deleted rogue service at `app/services/llm_config_service.py`
- Removed duplicate health check implementations
- Refactored health routes to use dependency injection
- Refactored document routes to use dependency injection
- Refactored all remaining route files to use the `create_router` pattern and dependency injection (fully automated)
- Implemented TokenManagementService and TransactionService
- Added API endpoints for user balance, transaction history, and token usage
- Added endpoints for add funds, manual debit (admin only), and refund (admin only)
- Added authentication and admin scaffolding to secure endpoints
- Improved user experience with cost estimation and low balance warning endpoints (planned)
- Updated FastAPI route structure for financial operations

## In Progress / Next Steps

- Implement proper dependency injection in all services (not just routes)
- Standardize error handling across all routes
- Unify health check implementation
- Implement exponential backoff for API calls
- Add or update tests for refactored code
- Add frontend integration and admin dashboard endpoints

## Notes

- All route files are now consistent and use the `create_router` pattern with dependency injection.
- Automation scripts are in place for future refactoring.
- Next recommended action: **Implement dependency injection in all services**.
