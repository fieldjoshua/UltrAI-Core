# System-wide Cleanup and Audit Progress

## Phase 3: Service Integration (In Progress)

### Completed Tasks

- Deleted rogue service at `app/services/llm_config_service.py`
- Removed duplicate health check implementations
- Refactored health routes to use dependency injection
- Refactored auth routes to use dependency injection
- Refactored analyze routes to use dependency injection
- Refactored recovery routes to use dependency injection
- Refactored orchestrator routes to use dependency injection
- Refactored document routes to use dependency injection
- Refactored LLM routes to use dependency injection
- Refactored user routes to use dependency injection
- Refactored Docker Model Runner routes to use create_router pattern

### Current Task

- Refactoring remaining route files to use create_router pattern (In Progress)
  - Progress: 0%

### Next Tasks

- Address linter issues in route files:
  - Fix function calls in argument defaults
  - Resolve variable usage in type expressions
  - Standardize dependency injection patterns
  - Resolve import resolution issues for Docker Model Runner adapters
  - Clean up unused imported variables
  - Address line length violations
  - Remove unused local variables
  - Add proper error handling for unresolved imports
  - Implement proper type hints for all route functions
  - Add comprehensive docstrings for all functions
- Implement proper dependency injection in all services
- Standardize error handling across all routes
- Unify health check implementation
- Implement exponential backoff for API calls

### Notes

- Recent changes have successfully implemented the create_router pattern across multiple route files
- Some linter issues remain regarding function calls in argument defaults and type expressions
- These issues will be addressed in a separate task to ensure consistent patterns across all route files
- Docker Model Runner routes have been refactored but require additional work to resolve import and dependency issues
- Future work will focus on standardizing error handling and improving code quality across all route files
