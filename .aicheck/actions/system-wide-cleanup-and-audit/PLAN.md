# PLAN: System-Wide Cleanup and Audit

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06
**Status:** Not Started

## 1. Objective

To restore stability, improve deployment speed, and create a clean, maintainable codebase that fully implements the patented UltrLLMOrchestrator system architecture. This includes proper implementation of the multi-layered analysis pipeline, model registry, and hardware acceleration support.

## 2. Current State

The current system has several architectural issues:

- Multiple singleton service instances
- Inconsistent dependency injection patterns
- Overlapping service responsibilities
- Duplicate implementations (e.g., health checks)
- Rogue services that need removal
- Inconsistent error handling
- Incomplete test coverage
- Missing patent-aligned features:
  - Multi-layered analysis pipeline
  - Model registry
  - Hardware acceleration
  - Complete prompt template system
  - Meta-analysis implementation
  - Ultra-synthesis stage
  - Hyper-level analysis

## 3. Target State

The target system will have:

- Clean, maintainable architecture
- Proper dependency injection
- Clear service boundaries
- Standardized error handling
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Single source of truth for configuration
- Unified health check implementation
- Full patent implementation:
  - Complete multi-layered analysis pipeline
  - Functional model registry
  - Hardware acceleration support
  - Comprehensive prompt templates
  - Meta-analysis capabilities
  - Ultra-synthesis functionality
  - Hyper-level analysis

## 4. Execution Plan

The detailed, step-by-step checklist for this action is maintained in `todo.md`. The plan is divided into five phases:

1. Code Removal & Restructuring
2. Core Architecture Implementation
3. Service Integration
4. Testing & Verification
5. Documentation & Deployment

## 5. Supporting Documentation

- **`CURRENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`**: An exhaustive, file-by-file manifest of the system in its current, broken state.
- **`TARGET_ARCHITECTURE.md`**: A detailed blueprint of the final, logically sound system we will build.

## 6. Testing & Verification

- All refactoring will be followed by a full test suite run
- Final deployment will be verified against the DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS checklist in `RULES.md`
- A `deployment-verification.md` will be created in `supporting_docs` upon completion
- Patent alignment will be verified through comprehensive testing

## 7. Success Criteria

- All tests pass
- No singleton service instances
- Consistent dependency injection
- Clear service boundaries
- Standardized error handling
- Complete test coverage
- Production deployment verified
- Patent features fully implemented
- Hardware acceleration working
- Performance metrics collected
