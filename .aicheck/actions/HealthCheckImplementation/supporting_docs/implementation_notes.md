# Health Check Implementation Notes

These notes document the design decisions and implementation details for the Ultra health check system.

## Design Goals

1. **Comprehensive**: Monitor all aspects of the system
2. **Non-invasive**: Minimal impact on application performance
3. **Extensible**: Easy to add new health checks
4. **Compatible**: Works with monitoring systems
5. **Actionable**: Provides useful information for resolving issues

## Architecture Decisions

### Health Check Registry

We implemented a centralized registry for all health checks to:

- Maintain a single source of truth for health status
- Enable filtered queries by service type
- Support caching of results to reduce overhead
- Provide overall system status based on critical services

### Standard Health Check Interface

Every health check follows the same interface, returning:

- `status`: Standard status value (ok, degraded, critical, etc.)
- `message`: Human-readable description of the status
- `details`: Service-specific details for diagnostics
- `timestamp`: When the check was performed
- `duration_ms`: How long the check took (performance metric)

This standardization enables consistent reporting and easier integration with monitoring systems.

### Service Types

We categorized services by type (database, cache, etc.) to:

- Group related services in the UI/API
- Allow filtering of health checks by type
- Enable type-specific health check logic

### Status Caching

Health checks can be resource-intensive, especially when checking external services. We implemented caching to:

- Reduce load on external services
- Improve response time for health check endpoints
- Allow forcing a fresh check when needed (`force_check=true`)

### Critical vs. Non-Critical Services

We differentiated between critical and non-critical services to:

- Accurately represent overall system health
- Prioritize issues for operators
- Support degraded vs. critical status distinction

## Implementation Details

### Timeouts and Thread Safety

Health checks can hang, especially when external services are down. We implemented:

- Timeouts for all health checks
- Thread-safe caching mechanism
- Error handling for all external requests

### Health Check Status Determination

The overall system status is determined as follows:

1. If any critical service is unavailable: `critical`
2. If any service is degraded or unavailable: `degraded`
3. Otherwise: `ok`

### LLM Provider Checks

For LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google), we check:

1. Whether the required module is available
2. Whether an API key is configured
3. Whether the API is accessible (lightweight request)

This approach gives a complete picture of LLM provider status while minimizing API usage.

### Database and Redis Checks

For database and Redis, we integrate with the existing fallback mechanisms to:

1. Check if the service is available
2. Check if we're using a fallback implementation
3. Report detailed connection information

### System Resource Checks

For system resources, we track:

1. Memory usage (total, available, percent)
2. Disk usage (total, free, percent)
3. CPU usage (percent, cores)

We also define thresholds for warning (degraded) and critical statuses.

## API Design

### Query Parameters

We implemented query parameters to customize health check responses:

- `detail`: Whether to include detailed service information
- `service`: Check only a specific service
- `type`: Filter services by type
- `include_system`: Whether to include system metrics
- `force_check`: Whether to force a fresh check

This approach allows clients to get exactly the information they need while minimizing overhead.

### Endpoint Structure

We structured the endpoints hierarchically:

- `/health`: Basic health check
- `/api/health`: Detailed health check
- `/api/health/system`: System resources
- `/api/health/dependencies`: Python dependencies
- `/api/health/services`: All services
- `/api/health/llm`: LLM providers

This structure provides clear organization and enables targeted checks.

## Integration with Existing Code

### Dependency Manager

We integrated with the existing dependency manager to:

- Report on Python module availability
- Track feature flags based on dependencies
- Provide installation commands for missing dependencies

### Graceful Degradation

We integrated with existing fallback mechanisms to:

- Report on fallback usage
- Show degraded status when using fallbacks
- Include details on fallback implementations

## Testing Strategy

We implemented comprehensive tests for all health check endpoints, covering:

1. Basic health check responses
2. Detailed health check responses
3. Service-specific checks
4. Error cases (invalid parameters, service not found)
5. Mocked service statuses (critical, degraded, etc.)

## Command-Line Tool

We created a command-line tool (`check_health.py`) that:

1. Connects to the health check endpoints
2. Formats output for terminal display (with colors)
3. Supports various modes (basic, detailed, system, LLM)
4. Includes a monitoring mode for continuous updates
5. Provides JSON output for scripting

This tool is valuable for operators and developers when troubleshooting issues.

## Documentation

We created comprehensive documentation explaining:

1. All available endpoints and their parameters
2. Response structure and status values
3. Integration with monitoring systems
4. Troubleshooting common issues
5. Extending the health check system

This documentation ensures that the health check system is easily usable by all stakeholders.
