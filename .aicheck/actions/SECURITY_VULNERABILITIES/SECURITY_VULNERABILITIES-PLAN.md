# Security Vulnerabilities Plan

## Overview

This action focuses on addressing the security vulnerabilities identified by GitHub's Dependabot in the repository. The vulnerabilities include 1 critical, 2 moderate, and 1 low severity issues.

## Goals

1. Address all identified security vulnerabilities
2. Implement proper security measures
3. Update dependencies to secure versions
4. Document security improvements

## Tasks

### 1. Vulnerability Assessment

- [ ] Review Dependabot alerts in GitHub
- [ ] Categorize vulnerabilities by severity
- [ ] Identify affected dependencies
- [ ] Document impact and potential risks

### 2. Critical Vulnerability (Priority 1)

- [ ] Identify the critical vulnerability
- [ ] Research the vulnerability details
- [ ] Plan the fix
- [ ] Implement the fix
- [ ] Test the fix
- [ ] Document the changes

### 3. Moderate Vulnerabilities (Priority 2)

- [ ] Identify the two moderate vulnerabilities
- [ ] Research each vulnerability
- [ ] Plan fixes for each
- [ ] Implement fixes
- [ ] Test fixes
- [ ] Document changes

### 4. Low Vulnerability (Priority 3)

- [ ] Identify the low severity vulnerability
- [ ] Research the vulnerability
- [ ] Plan the fix
- [ ] Implement the fix
- [ ] Test the fix
- [ ] Document the changes

### 5. Security Improvements

- [ ] Review current security practices
- [ ] Implement additional security measures
- [ ] Update security documentation
- [ ] Add security testing to CI/CD pipeline

### 6. Documentation

- [ ] Document all security fixes
- [ ] Update security guidelines
