# UltraAICheck Actions Index

> **Visualizer-Ready**: This file is parsed by the UltraAI Visualizer. Do not change column headers. Maintain consistent formatting to ensure parsing is successful.

This document serves as the central reference for all Actions in the project and is the source of truth for action statuses.

## Core Principle: Every Action Must Have a Plan

The UltraAI Framework operates on the fundamental principle that **every action must have a plan**:

- All substantive work is defined as an action
- Each action requires a formal, documented plan before implementation begins
- All active actions must be listed in this index
- Action plans are stored in the Actions directory with the action name
- No substantive work can proceed without being listed here as an action with a corresponding plan
