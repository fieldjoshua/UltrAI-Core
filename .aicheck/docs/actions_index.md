## Consolidation Notes

Several API-related actions have been consolidated:

- **APIIntegration**: Main action for API development (completed)
- **api_integration**: Duplicate/alternative naming of APIIntegration
- **API_DEVELOPMENT**: General API development tasks now part of APIIntegration
- **APIConsolidation**: Action that documents the consolidation process

UI-related actions:

- **UIPrototypeIntegration**: Completed UI implementation
- **FRONTEND_DEVELOPMENT**: Similar scope, consolidated with UIPrototypeIntegration
- **UIConsolidation**: Action that documents the consolidation process

## Priority Focus

Current focus is on **ImprovementsRedux** action, which builds upon completed work. The implementation prioritization is:

0. **ProductVisionDocument**: Create a comprehensive document that captures the product vision, features, and user experience to guide all development efforts.

1. **ImprovementsRedux**: Enhance existing components with:
   - API security improvements (rate limiting, validation)
   - Error handling across all components
   - Performance optimizations for orchestrator

2. **DeploymentAutomation**: Establish consistent deployment processes

3. **UltraTestingAndCI**: Implement comprehensive testing and CI/CD

4. **UltraDocumentationUpgrade**: Align documentation with consolidated architecture

5. **FeatherPatternExpansion**: Add new functionality after foundation is solid
