- Production deployment guide and configuration details
- API endpoint specifications and authentication flows
- Frontend component documentation and user interface guide
- Database schema and data models documentation
- Testing procedures and validation protocols
- Operational procedures and monitoring guidelines
- Security implementation and best practices

## Dependencies
