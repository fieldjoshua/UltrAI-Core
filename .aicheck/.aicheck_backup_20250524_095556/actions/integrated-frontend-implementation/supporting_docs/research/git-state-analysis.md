## Recommendations

1. **Clean Strategy**: Commit current changes as "Archive cleanup and action reorganization"
2. **Sync Strategy**: Pull latest 9 commits before implementing
3. **Safety**: Most changes are deletions of archived content - low risk
4. **Priority**: Focus on implementation over git archaeology

## Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: Changes are mostly archive cleanup
- **Medium Risk**: Some .aicheck modifications need validation
- **Action Required**: Clean commit and sync before implementation phase
