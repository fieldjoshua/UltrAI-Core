# TODO: integrated-frontend-implementation

## Active Tasks

### Phase 1: Research
- [ ] Analyze current git state (238 pending changes) (priority: high, status: pending)
- [ ] Review existing FastAPI StaticFiles configuration (priority: high, status: pending)
- [ ] Examine disabled frontend code for UI patterns (priority: medium, status: pending)
- [ ] Identify required frontend functionality (priority: high, status: pending)

### Phase 2: Design

- [ ] Plan API integration patterns (fetch, JWT handling) (priority: high, status: pending)
- [ ] Create UI wireframes for core functionality (priority: medium, status: pending)
- [ ] Define routing strategy (API vs static files) (priority: high, status: pending)

### Phase 3: Implementation

- [ ] Create static frontend files (HTML/CSS/JS) (priority: high, status: pending)
- [ ] Integrate StaticFiles mounting in FastAPI (priority: high, status: pending)
- [ ] Implement authentication UI and API calls (priority: high, status: pending)
- [ ] Add document upload and analysis interfaces (priority: high, status: pending)

### Phase 4: Testing
- [ ] Test static file serving locally (priority: high, status: pending)
- [ ] Verify API endpoints remain functional (priority: high, status: pending)
- [ ] Test authentication flow end-to-end (priority: high, status: pending)
- [ ] Validate document upload/analysis workflow (priority: high, status: pending)
- [ ] Deploy and test in production environment (priority: high, status: pending)

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Create ACTION directory structure
- [x] Set up supporting_docs directories
- [x] Create initial todo.md file

## Notes

- Backend API (ultrai-core.onrender.com) is fully functional
- Current frontend service returns 404 - needs complete replacement
- FastAPI already imports StaticFiles - ready for integration
- Single-service architecture will eliminate CORS and deployment complexity
- Estimated timeline: 2.5 days total implementation
