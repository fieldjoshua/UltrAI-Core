# AICheck System Updates Summary
Date: 2025-05-22
For: AICheck Development Team

## Overview
Major updates were made to RULES.md and the AICheck directory structure to improve action management and introduce integrated todo tracking.

## Key Changes to RULES.md

### 1. Todo Management Integration (NEW - Section 4)
Added comprehensive todo management requirements:

#### 4.1 Todo File Requirements
- **MANDATORY**: Every ACTION directory MUST contain a todo.md file
- Todo files track task progress, priorities, and completion status
- Claude Code automatically manages todo.md files using native todo functions
- Todo items must align with ACTION plan and success criteria

#### 4.2 Todo File Format
```markdown
# TODO: [Action Name]

## Active Tasks
- [ ] Task description (priority: high/medium/low, status: pending/in_progress/completed)

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Completed task description

## Notes
Additional context or dependencies for tasks
```

#### 4.3 Todo Management Workflow
- Claude Code automatically creates todo.md when starting an ACTION
- Tasks are derived from ACTION plan phases and requirements
- Progress tracked in real-time as tasks complete
- Todo status integrates with overall ACTION progress tracking

### 2. AI Editor Scope Updates (Section 2.1)
Added to AI editor permissions:
- Managing todo.md files within ActiveAction scope (creating, updating task status, marking complete)

### 3. Directory Structure Updates (Section 3.1)
Updated ACTION directory structure to include:
```
[action-name]/
├── [action-name]-plan.md # ACTION PLAN (requires approval)
├── todo.md              # ACTION TODO tracking (required) <-- NEW
└── supporting_docs/     # ACTION-specific documentation
```

## New Directory Structure Elements

### 1. Templates Directory
Created `.aicheck/templates/` containing:
- `TODO_TEMPLATE.md` - Standard template for new action todo files

### 2. Archive Structure
New archive structure for legacy actions:
```
ARCHIVE/
└── legacy-actions/
    ├── README.md              # Archive index and documentation
    ├── batch-created-may21/   # Bulk-created actions
    ├── old-naming-convention/ # Deprecated ALL_CAPS actions
    ├── duplicates/           # Redundant actions
    ├── pre-mvp/             # Pre-MVP phase actions
    └── misc-files/          # Non-action files (.md, .py, etc.)
```

## Implementation Notes

### Todo Integration with Claude Code
- Claude Code's native TodoWrite/TodoRead functions manage todo.md files
- No need for custom todo management code
- Todo status provides real-time progress tracking
- Integrates with existing AICheck progress tracking

### Action Organization Guidelines
Created comprehensive guidelines including:
- Naming conventions (lowercase-with-hyphens)
- Action lifecycle management
- Archival policies
- Maintenance schedules

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Better Progress Tracking**: Todo files provide granular task tracking
2. **Automated Management**: Claude Code handles todo creation/updates
3. **Consistency**: All actions follow same structure
4. **Historical Preservation**: Archive maintains project history
5. **Clarity**: Clean separation of active vs. legacy work

## Migration Requirements

For existing AICheck installations:
1. Add todo.md requirement to action creation process
2. Create templates directory with TODO_TEMPLATE.md
3. Update AI editor permissions to include todo management
4. Implement archive structure for legacy action management

## Recommended AICheck Updates

1. **Action Creation**: Auto-create todo.md from template
2. **Status Command**: Include todo completion percentage
3. **Progress Tracking**: Integrate todo status with progress reporting
4. **Template System**: Expand templates for common action types
5. **Archive Commands**: Add commands for archiving completed/abandoned actions
