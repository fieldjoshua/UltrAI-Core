# Action Organization Guidelines

Version: 1.0
Created: 2025-05-22
Purpose: Establish clear guidelines for action management going forward

## Action Naming Conventions

### DO Use:
- **Lowercase with hyphens**: `frontend-deployment-fix`
- **Descriptive names**: Clearly indicate the action's purpose
- **Verb-noun format**: `fix-deployment`, `update-documentation`
- **Specific scope**: `frontend-api-integration` not just `integration`

### DON'T Use:
- ALL_CAPS names (deprecated)
- Underscores in names
- Generic names like `improvements` or `updates`
- Overly long names (keep under 30 characters)

## Action Creation Criteria

Before creating a new action, verify:

1. **No Duplicate Exists**: Check if similar work is already tracked
2. **Clear Scope**: Can you define specific deliverables?
3. **Reasonable Size**: Can it be completed in 1-2 weeks?
4. **MVP Alignment**: Does it support core MVP functionality?

## Action Lifecycle

### 1. Creation
- Use `./aicheck action new action-name`
- Create comprehensive plan before starting work
- Add todo.md for task tracking
- Get approval for the plan

### 2. Active Development
- Update progress regularly
- Keep todo.md current
- Document dependencies as discovered
- Test work before marking complete

### 3. Completion
- Verify all success criteria met
- Document all dependencies
- Update actions_index.md
- Use `./aicheck action complete`

### 4. Archival (When Needed)
- Move to appropriate archive folder
- Update archive README.md
- Remove from actions_index.md
- Preserve any valuable documentation

## Directory Structure Requirements

Each action MUST have:
```
action-name/
├── action-name-plan.md      # Required: Action plan
├── todo.md                  # Required: Task tracking
├── progress.md              # Auto-generated by AICheck
├── status.txt               # Auto-generated by AICheck
└── supporting_docs/         # Optional: Additional documentation
    ├── claude-interactions/ # AI conversation logs
    ├── research/           # Background research
    └── test-results/       # Test outputs
```

## Archival Policy

Actions should be archived when:
- Work has been abandoned for 30+ days
- The action is no longer relevant to current goals
- A better approach has been implemented elsewhere
- The action was created in error or as duplicate

## Best Practices

1. **One Action, One Goal**: Each action should have a single, clear objective
2. **Document Everything**: Decisions, dependencies, and discoveries
3. **Test First**: Create tests before implementation when possible
4. **Regular Updates**: Update progress at least weekly for active actions
5. **Clean Completion**: Ensure all work is properly documented before closing

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Scope Creep**: Don't expand action beyond original plan
2. **Zombie Actions**: Don't leave actions in limbo - complete or archive
3. **Missing Dependencies**: Always document external and internal dependencies
4. **Poor Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names from the start
5. **Batch Creation**: Don't create many actions at once without immediate plans

## Maintenance Schedule

- **Weekly**: Review active actions for progress
- **Monthly**: Archive stale actions
- **Quarterly**: Full audit of action directory
- **As Needed**: Update these guidelines based on learnings

## Questions to Ask

Before creating an action:
- Is this work already covered by an existing action?
- Can I complete this in a reasonable timeframe?
- Do I have a clear plan and success criteria?
- Is this aligned with current MVP priorities?

Before archiving an action:
- Is there any valuable work or documentation to preserve?
- Should this be merged with another action instead?
- Is this truly abandoned or just paused?
