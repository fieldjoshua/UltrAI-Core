# Frontend Deployment Investigation

Date: 2025-05-22

## Key Finding

The frontend is already being served from the backend!

Looking at the git history:
- Commit `1d925ef8`: "Serve frontend directly from backend production app"

In `app_production.py` (lines 530-534):
```python
# Mount frontend static files at the end (after all API routes)
try:
    app.mount("/", StaticFiles(directory="frontend/dist", html=True), name="frontend")
except (RuntimeError, FileNotFoundError):
    # Frontend dist not found, continue without it
```

## Current Status

1. **Backend URL**: https://ultrai-core.onrender.com/
2. **Frontend**: Should be available at the same URL
3. **Separate Frontend Service**: No longer needed

## Next Steps

1. Test if frontend is accessible at https://ultrai-core.onrender.com/
2. If not, check if `frontend/dist` exists in the deployed container
3. The `ultrai-frontend.onrender.com` service can likely be removed

## Hypothesis

The frontend deployment at `ultrai-frontend.onrender.com` is returning 404 because:
1. It's no longer being used (frontend served from backend)
2. The service might have been disabled or removed
3. The render.yaml still references it but it's not active

## Action Required

1. Verify frontend access at backend URL
2. If working, update documentation to reflect single-service deployment
3. Remove references to separate frontend service
