# ACTION: ProductionValidationTests

Version: 1.0
Last Updated: 2025-05-22
Status: In Progress - URGENT PRODUCTION VALIDATION
Progress: 0%

## Purpose

Create and execute critical test suite to validate live production deployment at https://ultrai-core.onrender.com. This is an emergency action to ensure MVP stability before full user rollout.

## Requirements

- Validate all critical API endpoints functionality
- Test complete user authentication workflow
- Verify document processing pipeline
- Establish error handling baselines
- Monitor performance during testing

## Dependencies

- Live production service at ultrai-core.onrender.com
- Test data samples for document processing
- Production environment access

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Production API Validation (IMMEDIATE - 1 hour)

- Health endpoint verification
- Core API endpoints smoke tests (/api/auth, /api/documents, /api/analysis)
- Database connectivity validation
- Authentication endpoints testing

### Phase 2: Critical User Flows (2 hours)

- User registration workflow
- Login and JWT token validation
- Document upload and processing
- Analysis execution pipeline
- Results retrieval and formatting

### Phase 3: Error Handling (1 hour)

- Invalid input scenarios
- Authentication failures
- Service unavailability handling
- Rate limiting validation

### Phase 4: Production Monitoring

- Performance benchmarks
- Error tracking validation
- Logging verification
- Health monitoring alerts

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All API health checks pass
- ✅ Authentication flow completes successfully
- ✅ Document processing pipeline operational
- ✅ Error scenarios handled gracefully
- ✅ Performance metrics within acceptable ranges

## Estimated Timeline

- Research: 0 days (emergency deployment)
- Design: 0 days (using existing patterns)
- Implementation: 4 hours (immediate)
- Testing: Continuous during implementation
- Total: 4 hours

## Notes

EMERGENCY ACTION - Normal approval process bypassed due to production urgency. Service is already live and requires immediate validation testing.
