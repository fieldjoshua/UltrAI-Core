  - Integration tests must pass
  - No new failures introduced

- [ ] **Test critical user flows manually** (priority: high, status: pending)
  - User registration and login
  - Document upload and processing
  - API endpoint functionality

- [ ] **Verify resource constraints** (priority: high, status: pending)

  - Test memory usage

### Phase 5: Deployment & Monitoring

- [ ] **Deploy to production** (priority: high, status: pending)
  - Push updates to GitHub
  - Trigger Render deployment
  - Monitor deployment logs

- [ ] **Verify production functionality** (priority: high, status: pending)
  - All services start correctly
  - No runtime errors
  - Performance acceptable

- [ ] **Document final status** (priority: medium, status: pending)
  - List all resolved vulnerabilities
  - Note any remaining issues
  - Create follow-up plan if needed

## Completed Tasks

*Tasks that have been finished successfully*

- [x] **Create SecurityVulnerabilityFix action** (completed: 2025-05-22)
  - Created comprehensive action plan
  - Identified all phases and deliverables

## Notes

- Action plan reference: `security-vulnerability-fix-plan.md`
- Dependencies: Must maintain Render deployment constraints
- Critical consideration: Don't break production functionality
- GitHub URL: https://github.com/fieldjoshua/UltrAI-Core/security/dependabot

## Important Warnings

1. **Test each update individually** - Don't batch update all at once
2. **Monitor package sizes** - Some security updates add significant bloat
3. **Check for cascading updates** - One fix might require others
4. **Keep production stable** - This is a live system with users
