# Cost-Efficient Development Template

Automated template for cost-conscious Claude Code workflows with usage optimization.

## Template

```
COST-EFFICIENT DEVELOPMENT:

**Objective:** [Describe the development goal]
**Budget Awareness:** [Auto-tracked via ./aicheck context cost]

## AUTOMATED COST OPTIMIZATION:

### Pre-Development Analysis (Auto)
✅ **Automatic Steps:**
- Run ./aicheck context cost to assess current usage
- Auto-check context pollution score
- Generate context summary if large files detected
- Auto-optimize context if needed
- Set cost-conscious prompting mode

⚠️ **Cost Alerts:**
- High daily usage detected (>80%)
- Large context files (>10k) present  
- Complex thinking patterns in recent interactions

### Development Execution (Cost-Aware)
✅ **Efficient Patterns:**
- Use surgical fix templates for focused changes
- Leverage cached patterns and context summaries
- Implement graduated prompting (simple → complex)
- Auto-compact context every 5 interactions
- Use structured templates to reduce iterations

⚠️ **Cost Escalation Triggers:**
- Multiple failed attempts (>3)
- Context size growing rapidly
- Thinking-intensive operations exceeding threshold

### Auto-Monitoring During Development
✅ **Continuous Optimization:**
- Auto-track interaction frequency
- Monitor context growth patterns
- Auto-suggest template usage for common patterns
- Auto-compress old logs and cache patterns
- Generate cost-efficiency reports

## COMPLETION WITH COST ANALYSIS:
✅ **Auto-Complete When:**
- Objective achieved efficiently
- Context optimization maintained
- Usage patterns within normal ranges
- Cost efficiency score > 80%
```

## Example Usage

```
COST-EFFICIENT DEVELOPMENT:

**Objective:** Fix authentication bug in user login flow
**Budget Awareness:** Currently at 45% daily usage

### Expected Auto-Optimization:
1. **Pre-Analysis:** Auto-check if large auth files need summarization
2. **Efficient Execution:** Use surgical fix template to stay focused
3. **Monitoring:** Auto-alert if debugging takes >3 iterations
4. **Completion:** Auto-report cost efficiency score

### Cost Consciousness:
- Start with simple analysis before "think harder"
- Use existing pattern cache for auth flows
- Limit scope to specific login bug (no feature additions)
- Auto-compact logs if interaction count grows
```

## Smart Cost Features

- **Usage Pattern Learning:** Adapts to your typical development patterns
- **Context Size Management:** Auto-optimizes large files and complex projects
- **Graduated Prompting:** Escalates complexity only when needed
- **Template Suggestions:** Recommends efficient patterns for common tasks
- **Automatic Optimization:** Runs cost-saving measures transparently
- **Budget Awareness:** Tracks and reports usage relative to Claude Code limits

## Cost Efficiency Metrics

- **Context Utilization Ratio:** Effective content vs. total context size
- **Iteration Efficiency:** Success rate per interaction attempt  
- **Template Usage Rate:** Structured vs. ad-hoc prompting
- **Thinking Budget:** Complex vs. simple reasoning distribution
- **Focus Maintenance:** Boundary compliance and scope adherence
