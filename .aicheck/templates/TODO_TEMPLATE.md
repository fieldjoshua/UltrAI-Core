# TODO: [Action Name]

*This file tracks task progress for the [Action Name] action. Tasks are managed using Claude Code's native todo functions and should align with the action plan phases and success criteria.*

## Active Tasks

*Tasks currently in progress or pending. Use status indicators: pending, in_progress, completed*

- [ ] **Example Task 1** (priority: high, status: pending)
  - Description of what needs to be done
  - Any specific requirements or constraints

- [ ] **Example Task 2** (priority: medium, status: pending)
  - Another task description
  - Dependencies or prerequisites

## Completed Tasks

*Tasks that have been finished successfully*

- [x] **Example Completed Task** (completed: YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Description of what was accomplished
  - Any notes about the implementation

## Notes

*Additional context, dependencies, or important information for task management*

- Action plan reference: `[action-name]-plan.md`
- Dependencies: List any external or internal dependencies
- Progress tracking: Link to overall action progress
- Special considerations: Any unique requirements or constraints

## Task Management Guidelines

- Tasks should be derived from action plan phases
- Use Claude Code's TodoWrite/TodoRead functions to manage this file
- Mark tasks as in_progress when actively working on them
- Complete tasks immediately after finishing work
- Keep only one task in_progress at a time when possible
- Add new tasks as they become apparent during implementation
