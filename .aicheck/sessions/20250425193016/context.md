## Core Capabilities

The UltraAI Framework implements advanced document processing capabilities:

1. **Document Upload and Validation**
   - Support for multiple file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)
   - File size and type validation
   - Virus scanning and security checks
   - Batch upload capabilities

2. **Text Extraction and Processing**
   - OCR for scanned documents
   - Structure preservation for formatted documents
   - Metadata extraction and indexing
