# Supporting Documentation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the organization and management of supporting documentation for the UltraAI project.

## Structure

- Documentation is organized under `.aicheck/actions/`
- Each action has its own directory with a main plan file and supporting documentation
- Supporting documentation is stored in `supporting_docs/` subdirectories

## Current Status

- Documentation has been migrated from old structure to new `.aicheck` format
- Action plans and supporting docs are properly organized
- Old documentation has been archived

## Next Steps

1. Review and update any remaining documentation references
2. Ensure all action plans are complete and up to date
3. Validate documentation structure against project requirements

## Changelog

- 2024-03-26: Initial migration of documentation to `.aicheck` structure
