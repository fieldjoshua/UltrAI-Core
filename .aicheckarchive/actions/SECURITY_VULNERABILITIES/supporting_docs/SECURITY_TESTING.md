# Security Testing Approach

## Overview

This document outlines the security testing strategy for the UltraAI platform, focusing on automated and manual testing approaches.

## Automated Testing

### 1. Static Analysis

- Bandit for Python code security scanning
- ESLint security rules for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Safety for dependency vulnerability checking
- GitHub Dependabot for automated dependency updates

### 2. Dynamic Analysis

- API security testing
- Input validation testing
- Authentication testing
- Authorization testing
- Rate limiting testing

### 3. CI/CD Integration

- Weekly automated security scans
- Pull request security checks
- Dependency update monitoring
- Test coverage requirements (80% minimum)

## Manual Testing

### 1. Code Review

- Security-focused code reviews
- Credential handling review
- API security review
- Data handling review

### 2. Penetration Testing

- API endpoint testing
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Authorization testing
- Data exposure testing

### 3. Security Audit

- Configuration review
- Access control review
- Encryption review
- Logging review

## Test Implementation

### 1. Automated Tests

```python
# Example security test structure
def test_security_feature():
    # Setup
    # Action
    # Assert
    pass
```

### 2. Manual Test Checklist

- [ ] Review code for security best practices
- [ ] Test authentication mechanisms
- [ ] Verify authorization controls
- [ ] Check data encryption
- [ ] Validate input handling
- [ ] Test rate limiting
- [ ] Review error handling
- [ ] Check logging practices

## Test Coverage Requirements

### 1. Code Coverage

- Minimum 80% coverage for security-critical code
- 100% coverage for authentication/authorization
- 100% coverage for encryption/decryption
- 100% coverage for input validation

### 2. Test Types

- Unit tests for security functions
- Integration tests for security flows
- End-to-end tests for security features
- Penetration tests for vulnerabilities

## Reporting

### 1. Automated Reports

- Security scan results
- Test coverage reports
- Dependency update reports
- Vulnerability reports

### 2. Manual Reports

- Code review findings
- Penetration test results
- Security audit findings
- Risk assessment reports

## Maintenance

### 1. Regular Updates

- Weekly security test runs
- Monthly penetration tests
- Quarterly security audits
- Annual comprehensive review

### 2. Documentation

- Test results documentation
- Vulnerability tracking
- Fix implementation tracking
- Security improvement tracking
