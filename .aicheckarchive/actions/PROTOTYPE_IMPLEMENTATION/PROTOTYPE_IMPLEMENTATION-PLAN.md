# Action: PROTOTYPE_IMPLEMENTATION

Created: 2025-04-25

## Objective

Implement the core prototype of the UltraAI system, focusing on the essential architecture and functionality, specifically the query processing, LLM selection, and analysis capabilities.

## Context

This is a Priority 1 (Core Architecture) action that establishes the foundation for all components. The prototype implementation will serve as the basis for all subsequent development work. The focus is on making the core query and analysis functionality work, while deferring other features like pricing, add-ons, user profiles, and point of sale.

## Requirements

1. Core Architecture
   - Implement FastAPI backend with proper configuration
   - Set up Pydantic models and settings
   - Establish proper error handling
   - Configure CORS and security settings

2. Essential Features
   - Query processing system
   - LLM selection and management
   - Analysis framework
   - Basic API endpoints structure
   - Configuration management
   - Error handling system
   - Documentation setup

3. Quality Standards
   - Follow Python best practices
   - Maintain proper type hints
   - Document all major components
   - Ensure proper error handling

4. Core Functionality Implementation
   - [x] Implement query processing system
     - [x] Create query validation and preprocessing
     - [x] Implement query routing to appropriate LLMs
     - [x] Add query result aggregation

   - [x] Implement LLM management
     - [x] Set up LLM configuration system
     - [x] Implement LLM selection logic
     - [x] Add LLM response handling

   - [x] Implement analysis framework
     - [x] Create analysis pattern system
     - [x] Implement result comparison
     - [x] Add confidence scoring

   - [x] Connect frontend to backend
     - [x] Replace mock API responses with real implementations
     - [x] Implement proper error handling
     - [x] Add loading states and feedback

   - [x] Testing and validation
     - [x] Write unit tests for core functionality
     - [x] Add integration tests
     - [x] Perform end-to-end testing

## Status

Status: Completed
Progress: 100%

## Dependencies

- FastAPI
- Pydantic
- SQLAlchemy
- Python-dotenv
- Loguru
- Email-validator
- aiosqlite
- python-jose[cryptography]
- passlib[bcrypt]

## Notes

- This is a core architecture action that must be completed before other actions can proceed
- Focus on establishing solid foundations rather than feature completeness
- Ensure all components are properly documented
- Defer implementation of pricing, add-ons, user profiles, and point of sale features
- Priority is on making the core query, LLM selection, and analysis functionality work
