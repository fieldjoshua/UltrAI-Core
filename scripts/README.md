# Scripts Documentation Has Moved

## IMPORTANT: Documentation First Approach

**The scripts documentation has been consolidated in the `documentation/` directory.**

Please refer to:

- [SCRIPT_UTILITIES.md](../documentation/guidelines/SCRIPT_UTILITIES.md) - Comprehensive script utilities documentation
- [DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md](../documentation/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md) - Index of all documentation

## DO NOT UPDATE THIS FILE

This directory contains script utilities, but the documentation has been moved.
Please update and refer to the documentation in the `documentation/` directory.

All future documentation updates should be made in the consolidated documentation structure.
