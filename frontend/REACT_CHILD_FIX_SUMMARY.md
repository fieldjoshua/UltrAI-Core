# React Child Object Error Fix Summary

## Issue

The error "Objects are not valid as a React child" was occurring in the frontend when API responses returned objects instead of strings for certain fields.

## Root Cause

Several components were directly rendering API response fields without checking if they were strings or objects. When the API returned objects (e.g., for error details, response metadata, etc.), React would throw an error.

## Fixed Files and Locations

### 1. `/src/components/MultimodalAnalysis.tsx`

- **Line 267**: Fixed rendering of `response.response` in individual model responses
- **Line 293**: Fixed rendering of `analysisResults.combined_response`

### 2. `/src/pages/SimpleAnalysis.tsx`

- **Line 553**: Fixed rendering of `response.response` in the main results view
- **Lines 721 & 747**: Fixed rendering of `modelResponse.response` in both side-by-side views

### 3. `/src/pages/ModelRunnerDemo.tsx`

- **Line 57**: Fixed how `response.data.response` is stored to ensure it's always a string

## Fix Pattern Applied

All fixes follow the same pattern to ensure objects are converted to strings before rendering:

```typescript
{
  typeof value === 'string'
    ? value
    : typeof value === 'object' && value !== null
      ? JSON.stringify(value, null, 2)
      : String(value || 'Fallback message');
}
```

This pattern:

1. Checks if the value is already a string (most common case)
2. If it's an object, converts it to a formatted JSON string
3. Otherwise, converts it to a string with a fallback message

## Testing

The frontend build completed successfully after these changes, indicating no TypeScript or build errors.

## Recommendation

Consider updating the API response types to ensure consistency, or create utility functions to handle response formatting centrally.
