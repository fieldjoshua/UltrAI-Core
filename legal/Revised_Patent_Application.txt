TITLE: System and Method for Multi-Model Large Language Model Analysis Orchestration

ABSTRACT:
A system and method are disclosed for orchestrating analysis across multiple distinct Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enhanced insights. The system receives a user prompt and optionally contextual data, facilitating user selection of multiple LLMs and a specific analysis pattern from a predefined set (e.g., confidence analysis, critique, scenario analysis). Optional analysis features (a la carte options) may also be selected. An orchestrator module manages the distribution of the prompt and context to the selected LLMs according to the chosen analysis pattern, which dictates the interaction model or initial processing of individual LLM responses. A synthesis step utilizes a designated LLM or process to analyze and combine the individual LLM responses, generating a final, synthesized response (Ultra Response). This multi-model, pattern-driven, synthesized approach provides improved accuracy, robustness, reduced bias, and deeper insights compared to single-LLM systems.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:
The field of artificial intelligence has seen significant advancements, particularly with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of understanding and generating human-like text. While individual LLMs from various providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) demonstrate impressive capabilities, they inherently possess limitations when used in isolation for complex analytical tasks.

Reliance on a single LLM often results in outputs that may reflect the specific biases present in its training data, exhibit "hallucinations" (generating factually incorrect information), or lack nuanced perspectives. Different LLMs, trained on diverse datasets and utilizing distinct architectures, often produce varied responses to identical prompts, highlighting their individual strengths, weaknesses, and potential blind spots. Users seeking robust, high-confidence analysis face challenges in determining the reliability of a single model's output.

Furthermore, while users can manually query multiple LLMs, effectively synthesizing their disparate outputs into a cohesive, enhanced result is a complex, time-consuming, and non-systematic process. Current attempts at automated multi-model integration often rely on simplistic methods like sequential processing (leading to high latency) or basic aggregation/voting mechanisms. These approaches fail to leverage the potential synergistic effects of targeted multi-model interaction and lack sophisticated mechanisms for cross-model analysis, refinement, and synthesis tailored to specific analytical goals. They also struggle to efficiently manage the complexities of interacting with multiple APIs, including varying capabilities, response times, rate limits, and error conditions.

Therefore, a need exists for a system and method that can systematically orchestrate interactions among multiple distinct LLMs, applying specific analytical frameworks (patterns) to guide their collaboration and synthesizing their outputs to produce a result superior in accuracy, depth, and reliability compared to what any single LLM or simple combination could achieve alone. The present invention, UltraAI, addresses this need by providing a structured, user-configurable platform for multi-model analysis and synthesis.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:
The present invention provides a system and method for orchestrating multiple distinct Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform complex analysis tasks based on user input. The system comprises a user interface module, an orchestration module (backend), and interfaces to communicate with a plurality of LLM APIs.

The user interface guides a user through a multi-step process to define an analysis task, including: inputting a primary prompt; optionally providing context data; selecting two or more distinct LLMs from an available pool; selecting a specific analysis pattern dictating how the selected LLMs will be utilized and their outputs processed (e.g., confidence scoring, critique, scenario generation); selecting optional 'a la carte' features to modify the analysis or output; and specifying a desired output format.

The orchestration module receives these user specifications and manages the execution flow. It distributes the prompt and context data to the selected LLMs, applying the logic defined by the chosen analysis pattern. This may involve parallel or sequential calls to the LLMs, and potentially feeding the output of one LLM as input to another, depending on the pattern. The orchestrator handles API interactions, including rate limiting and error retries. Crucially, the orchestrator executes a synthesis step, typically employing a designated LLM (Ultra Model), which analyzes the individual responses received from the selected LLMs in the context of the chosen analysis pattern and optional features, generating a final, synthesized output (Ultra Response).

This structured, pattern-driven orchestration and synthesis process allows the system to leverage the diverse capabilities of multiple LLMs, mitigate individual model weaknesses, and produce a final analysis that is more comprehensive, nuanced, reliable, and tailored to the user's specific analytical goal than could be achieved by a single LLM or simple multi-model aggregation.
