TITLE: System and Method for Multi-Model Large Language Model Analysis Orchestration

ABSTRACT:
A system and method are disclosed for orchestrating analysis across multiple distinct Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enhanced insights. The system receives a user prompt and optionally contextual data, facilitating user selection of multiple LLMs and a specific analysis pattern from a predefined set (e.g., confidence analysis, critique, scenario analysis). Optional analysis features (a la carte options) may also be selected. An orchestrator module manages the distribution of the prompt and context to the selected LLMs according to the chosen analysis pattern, which dictates the interaction model or initial processing of individual LLM responses. A synthesis step utilizes a designated LLM or process to analyze and combine the individual LLM responses, generating a final, synthesized response (Ultra Response). This multi-model, pattern-driven, synthesized approach provides improved accuracy, robustness, reduced bias, and deeper insights compared to single-LLM systems.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:
The field of artificial intelligence has seen significant advancements, particularly with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of understanding and generating human-like text. While individual LLMs from various providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) demonstrate impressive capabilities, they inherently possess limitations when used in isolation for complex analytical tasks.

Reliance on a single LLM often results in outputs that may reflect the specific biases present in its training data, exhibit "hallucinations" (generating factually incorrect information), or lack nuanced perspectives. Different LLMs, trained on diverse datasets and utilizing distinct architectures, often produce varied responses to identical prompts, highlighting their individual strengths, weaknesses, and potential blind spots. Users seeking robust, high-confidence analysis face challenges in determining the reliability of a single model's output.

Furthermore, while users can manually query multiple LLMs, effectively synthesizing their disparate outputs into a cohesive, enhanced result is a complex, time-consuming, and non-systematic process. Current attempts at automated multi-model integration often rely on simplistic methods like sequential processing (leading to high latency) or basic aggregation/voting mechanisms. These approaches fail to leverage the potential synergistic effects of targeted multi-model interaction and lack sophisticated mechanisms for cross-model analysis, refinement, and synthesis tailored to specific analytical goals. They also struggle to efficiently manage the complexities of interacting with multiple APIs, including varying capabilities, response times, rate limits, and error conditions.

Therefore, a need exists for a system and method that can systematically orchestrate interactions among multiple distinct LLMs, applying specific analytical frameworks (patterns) to guide their collaboration and synthesizing their outputs to produce a result superior in accuracy, depth, and reliability compared to what any single LLM or simple combination could achieve alone. The present invention, UltraAI, addresses this need by providing a structured, user-configurable platform for multi-model analysis and synthesis.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:
The present invention provides a system and method for enhancing the analysis capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by orchestrating interactions among multiple distinct models based on user-defined parameters and analysis patterns.

System Architecture:
The system comprises several key components:
1.  **User Interface (UI) Module:** Implemented as a web-based frontend (e.g., using HTML, CSS, JavaScript), the UI presents a structured multi-step workflow to the user. It allows users to input primary prompts, optionally upload contextual data, select multiple target LLMs from a dynamically populated list, choose a specific analysis pattern, select optional 'a la carte' features, specify the desired output format, and view the final synthesized results.
2.  **Orchestration Module (Backend):** Typically implemented as a server application (e.g., using Python with a web framework like FastAPI), this module acts as the central controller. It exposes APIs to serve data to the UI (e.g., lists of available models, patterns, options) and receives the user's complete analysis request specifications from the UI. Based on these specifications, particularly the chosen analysis pattern, it manages the interaction with selected LLM APIs, executes the synthesis process, and returns the final results.
3.  **LLM Interface Connectors:** These are components within the backend responsible for communicating with the external APIs of various third-party LLMs (e.g., OpenAI API, Anthropic API, Google Gemini API). They handle request formatting, API key management, and response parsing for each specific LLM service.
4.  **(Optional) Database:** A database may be used for storing user information, analysis history, cached results, or system configuration data.

Process Flow (User Workflow and Orchestration Logic):
The system typically operates according to the following multi-step process, often guided by the UI:

Step 1: Prompt Input
The user initiates the process by providing a natural language prompt detailing the query or analysis task to be performed via the User Interface.

Step 2: Context Addition (Optional)
The user interface provides an option for the user to upload or link supplementary documents or data to provide additional context for the analysis. The Orchestration Module preprocesses this context as needed (e.g., chunking, summarization) for efficient use by the LLMs. [Note: This feature may be marked as planned for future implementation].

Step 3: AI Model Selection
The User Interface presents a list of available LLMs, potentially retrieved via an API call to the Orchestration Module (`/api/models`). This list may include metadata about each model (provider, capabilities). The user selects two or more distinct LLMs to participate in the analysis. The selection is sent to the Orchestration Module.

Step 4: Analysis Method (Pattern) Selection
The User Interface presents a list of predefined Analysis Patterns, retrieved via an API call (`/api/analysis-types`). Each pattern defines a specific methodology for how the selected LLMs will be utilized and their outputs processed (e.g., Confidence Analysis, Critique, Scenario Analysis). The user selects one pattern. The choice of pattern dictates the subsequent logic executed by the Orchestration Module, including the specific prompts sent to the LLMs and the nature of the synthesis step. [Detailed explanation of key patterns like Confidence Analysis, Critique, etc., based on the 'Prompt Structure' table, would be inserted here, explaining the multi-stage prompts and expected intelligence multiplication effect].

Step 5: A La Carte Option Selection (Optional)
The User Interface presents a list of optional features or analysis modifications, retrieved via an API call (`/api/alacarte-options`), such as requesting citations or highlighting uncertainty. The user may select one or more options. These selections further modify the prompts used and the final synthesis logic within the Orchestration Module.

Step 6: Output Format Selection
The User Interface presents options for the desired format of the final synthesized response, retrieved via an API call (`/api/output-formats`), such as a concise summary, a detailed report, or bullet points. The user selects the preferred format.

Step 7: Processing and Results Display
Upon receiving all user selections (prompt, context, models, pattern, options, format) via a processing request (e.g., to `/api/process`), the Orchestration Module executes the core analysis workflow:
    a.  **LLM Interaction:** Sends appropriately formatted prompts (potentially incorporating context and pattern-specific instructions) to the APIs of the selected LLMs. This may involve parallel asynchronous requests to improve efficiency. API rate limits are managed, and retry mechanisms (e.g., exponential backoff) are employed for transient errors.
    b.  **Response Collection:** Receives the individual responses from each selected LLM.
    c.  **Synthesis:** Invokes a synthesis process, typically using a designated high-capability LLM (referred to as the Ultra Model). This synthesis LLM receives the original prompt, context, the chosen pattern, selected options, and the collection of individual LLM responses. It is prompted to analyze these inputs according to the pattern's goal (e.g., assess confidence, perform critique, synthesize scenarios) and generate the final, cohesive Ultra Response. The synthesis prompt is tailored based on the selected pattern and options.
    d.  **Formatting:** Formats the generated Ultra Response according to the user's selected output format (Step 6).
    e.  **Result Presentation:** Returns the final formatted Ultra Response (and potentially the intermediate individual LLM responses and performance metrics) to the User Interface for display to the user.
