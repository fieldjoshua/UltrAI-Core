# Git Update Instructions

Since we're having issues with terminal commands, here are the manual steps to update your Git repository:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the Ultra project directory:
   ```
   cd /Users/joshuafield/Documents/Ultra
   ```

2. Check the status of changes:
   ```
   git status
   ```

3. Add the modified files:
   ```
   git add src/components/UltraWithDocuments.tsx
   git add src/App.tsx
   git add src/index.css
   ```

4. Commit the changes:
   ```
   git commit -m "Update UI: Enhanced thinking model display with special purple borders, fixed TypeScript errors, and improved right column width"
   ```

5. Push the changes (if you have a remote repository):
   ```
   git push
   ```

## Summary of Changes Made

1. Fixed TypeScript linting errors:
   - Removed unused imports (React, User, BookOpen, Sparkles, TabsContent, etc.)
   - Removed unused variables (keepDataPrivate, setKeepDataPrivate)

2. Enhanced the UI:
   - Widened the right column from 1/4 to 1/3 of the available space
   - Added special visual treatment for "thinking models" (GPT-4 and Claude)
   - Created a purple pulsing border effect for recommended models
   - Added "Recommended for synthesis" labels 
   - Improved breathing animation on the neon blue border

3. Known Issues:
   - You mentioned that analyses aren't being run in the new format. This may need additional investigation.
   - There might be issues with the Vite configuration based on the console output showing path resolution problems with @/lib/utils.

To address the analysis not running issue, you might need to check:
- API connections to the backend
- Console errors in the browser
- Network requests when attempting to run analyses
