# Documentation Has Moved

## IMPORTANT: Documentation First Approach

**The developer documentation has been consolidated in the `documentation/` directory.**

Please refer to:

- [DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](../../documentation/guidelines/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) - Comprehensive developer guide
- [DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md](../../documentation/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md) - Index of all documentation

## DO NOT UPDATE THIS FILE

This directory is deprecated and maintained only for backwards compatibility.
Please update and refer to the documentation in the `documentation/` directory.

All future documentation updates should be made in the consolidated documentation structure.
