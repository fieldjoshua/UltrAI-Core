# Test Merge Summary

## What was merged into test_llm_adapters_comprehensive.py

### From test_resilient_llm_adapter.py
✅ **Merged the following test classes and functionality:**

1. **TestCircuitBreaker** - Complete circuit breaker functionality testing:
   - Circuit breaker initialization
   - Opens after failure threshold
   - Half-open state after timeout
   - Async circuit breaker operations

2. **TestResilientLLMAdapter** - Resilient adapter wrapper tests:
   - Successful generation with metrics
   - Retry on timeout behavior
   - No retry on client errors (4xx)
   - Circuit breaker integration
   - Exponential backoff with jitter
   - Provider-specific timeouts
   - Metrics tracking
   - Resource cleanup

3. **TestProviderConfigurations** - Provider-specific config validation:
   - OpenAI configuration (30s timeout, 5 failure threshold)
   - Anthropic configuration (45s timeout, 3 failure threshold)
   - Google configuration (25s timeout, 4 max attempts)

4. **TestResilientAdapterIntegration** - Integration tests:
   - create_resilient_adapter provider detection

### From test_llm_adapters.py
❌ **Not merged** - Functionality already covered:
- Basic missing API key test (already in TestBaseAdapter)
- Monkeypatch-based timeout tests (already covered with patch/mock)

### From test_standardized_llm_errors.py
❌ **Not merged** - Enhanced adapters are behind a disabled feature flag:
- EnhancedOpenAIAdapter tests
- EnhancedAnthropicAdapter tests
- LLMErrorResponse model tests
- These are for a feature (USE_ENHANCED_LLM_ADAPTERS) that's not actively used

### Additional tests added
✅ **Added new test classes to improve coverage:**

1. **TestRateLimitHandling** - More detailed rate limit testing:
   - OpenAI rate limit with retry-after header
   - Gemini quota exceeded error

2. **TestErrorConsistency** - Cross-adapter error consistency:
   - Verifies all adapters use consistent error format

## Key Points

1. The production code uses `create_resilient_adapter()` to wrap all LLM adapters, making the resilient adapter tests critical for production behavior.

2. The enhanced adapters from test_standardized_llm_errors.py are not currently used in production (behind a feature flag), so those tests were not merged.

3. All unique functionality from test_resilient_llm_adapter.py has been merged, including circuit breaker, retry logic, exponential backoff, and provider configurations.

4. The comprehensive test file now covers:
   - Base adapter functionality
   - Individual adapter implementations (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, HuggingFace)
   - Resilient wrapper functionality
   - Circuit breaker patterns
   - Retry and backoff strategies
   - Provider-specific configurations
   - Error consistency across adapters
