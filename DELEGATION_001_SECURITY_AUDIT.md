# [DELEGATE] Security Vulnerability Audit

**Task ID**: DELEGATION_001  
**Assigned to**: Oversight AI  
**Priority**: ðŸ”´ High  
**Created**: 2025-01-14 11:47 PST  
**Created by**: Claude-1

## Task Description

Please conduct a comprehensive security vulnerability audit and create a remediation plan for the 10 vulnerabilities reported by GitHub Dependabot.

## Expected Outputs

1. **Vulnerability Analysis Report**
   - List all 10 vulnerabilities with severity levels
   - Identify which packages are affected
   - Assess potential impact on our application
   - Note any that are false positives

2. **Remediation Plan**
   - Prioritized order for fixing (high severity first)
   - Specific version updates needed
   - Potential breaking changes to watch for
   - Testing strategy for each update

3. **Compatibility Research**
   - Check if updates are compatible with our current setup
   - Identify any cascading dependency updates needed
   - Note any major version bumps that need careful testing

## Context

- **GitHub Security URL**: https://github.com/fieldjoshua/UltrAI-Core/security/dependabot
- **Current Environment**: Python/FastAPI backend, React frontend
- **Key Dependencies**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Redis, OpenAI, Anthropic SDKs
- **Production Readiness**: These fixes are blocking production deployment

## How to Access

1. Visit the GitHub security page
2. Review each vulnerability alert
3. Check our `requirements-production.txt` and `package.json`
4. Research each package update

## Specific Questions to Answer

1. What is the high severity vulnerability and how urgent is it?
2. Can we update all packages without breaking changes?
3. Which updates require the most testing?
4. Should we update packages individually or in groups?
5. Are there any security fixes we can apply without updating packages?

## Resources

- Current dependency files:
  - `/requirements-production.txt` (Python)
  - `/frontend/package.json` (JavaScript)
- Our Python version: Check `runtime.txt` or Render config
- Node version: Check Render config

## Report Format

Please provide your findings in a structured markdown file:
```markdown
