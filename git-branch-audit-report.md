# Git Branch and Deployment Audit Report

## Executive Summary

The Ultra AI project has significant branch divergence and deployment confusion. The main issues are:
- **Production branch is 61 commits ahead of main, while main is 23 commits ahead of production**
- **No development branch exists** (mentioned in user comment but not present)
- **Render is deploying from an unknown branch** (configuration unclear)
- **Multiple unused branches creating confusion**

## Current State

### Branch Status

1. **Active Branches:**
   - `main` (default branch on GitHub)
   - `production` (current local branch, significantly diverged)
   - `master` (legacy, should be removed)
   - 40+ feature/dependabot branches

2. **Branch Divergence:**
   - production → main: 61 commits ahead
   - main → production: 23 commits ahead
   - This indicates these branches have diverged significantly without proper merging

3. **Recent Commits:**
   - **main branch**: Focused on API fixes and model availability
   - **production branch**: UI improvements, model updates, and visual enhancements

### Deployment Configuration

1. **Render Configuration (render.yaml):**
   - Service name: `ultrai-core`
   - Deploys using `app_production.py`
   - URL: https://ultrai-core.onrender.com/
   - Currently shows "degraded" status with LLM services failing

2. **GitHub Actions:**
   - CI/CD pipeline configured to deploy from `main` branch only
   - Multiple workflow files present (some may be redundant)
   - Deployment triggered on push to main

3. **Current Deployment Status:**
   - API is running but in degraded state
   - Health endpoint: `/api/health` (not `/health` as expected by CI/CD)
   - Environment: production
   - Version: 1.0.0
   - Uptime: ~14 hours

### Issues Identified

1. **Branch Strategy Confusion:**
   - No clear git flow (main vs production vs development)
   - Production branch has UI features not in main
   - Main branch has API fixes not in production

2. **Deployment Uncertainty:**
   - render.yaml exists but actual deployment source unclear
   - GitHub Actions only deploy from main
   - Production branch changes not reaching deployment

3. **Configuration Differences:**
   - `app_production.py` differs between branches (environment loading)
   - No significant differences in package.json or requirements files
   - Multiple production-specific files exist

4. **Missing Development Branch:**
   - User mentions development branch but it doesn't exist
   - No clear development → staging → production flow

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Determine Current Deployment Source:**
   ```bash
   # Check Render dashboard for actual deployment branch
   # Verify webhook configuration
   ```

2. **Create Branch Sync Plan:**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Make production the new main
   git checkout main
   git merge production --strategy=ours  # Keep production changes
   git push origin main
   
   # Option 2: Merge production back to main properly
   git checkout main
   git merge production  # Resolve conflicts carefully
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Clean Up Branches:**
   ```bash
   # Delete old branches
   git branch -d master
   git push origin --delete master
   
   # Clean up old feature branches
   # List branches older than 3 months for deletion
   ```

### Long-term Strategy

1. **Implement Proper Git Flow:**
   - `main` - stable production code
   - `develop` - integration branch
   - `feature/*` - individual features
   - `hotfix/*` - production fixes

2. **Update CI/CD:**
   - Deploy staging from develop
   - Deploy production from main
   - Add branch protection rules

3. **Documentation:**
   - Document deployment process
   - Create branch strategy guide
   - Update CLAUDE.md with git workflow

### Critical Path Forward

1. **URGENT: Determine what branch Render is actually deploying from**
2. **Merge production changes to main (UI improvements are production-ready)**
3. **Update render.yaml and GitHub Actions to ensure consistency**
4. **Create develop branch from main after merge**
5. **Document and communicate new branch strategy**

## Affected Files

Key files with branch differences:
- `app_production.py` - Environment loading differences
- Frontend UI components - Significant improvements in production branch
- Model configurations - Different model lists between branches

## Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Deployment source uncertainty could lead to wrong code in production
- **Medium Risk**: Branch divergence making it hard to track features
- **Low Risk**: No critical security differences between branches

## Action Plan

### Step 1: Verify Deployment Source (IMMEDIATE)
```bash
# Check Render dashboard for deployment branch
# Look for "GitHub Integration" settings
# Verify webhook URL and branch
```

### Step 2: Analyze Branch Differences
```bash
# Create detailed diff report
git log --oneline --no-merges origin/production ^origin/main > production-only-commits.txt
git log --oneline --no-merges origin/main ^origin/production > main-only-commits.txt

# Check for conflicting changes
git checkout main
git merge --no-commit --no-ff production
git status
git merge --abort
```

### Step 3: Reconcile Branches
```bash
# Option A: If production branch has the correct code
git checkout main
git reset --hard origin/production
git push --force-with-lease origin main

# Option B: Proper merge with conflict resolution
git checkout -b reconcile-branches
git merge origin/main
git merge origin/production
# Resolve conflicts
git checkout main
git merge reconcile-branches
```

### Step 4: Clean Up Repository
```bash
# Delete unused branches
git branch -r | grep -E "dependabot|feature/" | xargs -n 1 git push --delete origin

# Remove local tracking
git remote prune origin
```

### Step 5: Implement Proper Git Flow
```bash
# Create development branch
git checkout -b develop origin/main
git push -u origin develop

# Update branch protection rules on GitHub
# Configure Render to deploy from main
# Set up staging deployment from develop
```

## Summary

The repository is in a state of "deployment confusion" where:
1. The production branch has UI improvements not in main
2. The main branch has API fixes not in production  
3. It's unclear which branch Render is actually deploying
4. No proper development/staging/production flow exists

This needs immediate attention to prevent deployment of wrong code and to establish a clear, sustainable workflow.
