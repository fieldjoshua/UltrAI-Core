## Usage

### Local Development with Docker

```bash
cd deployment/docker
docker-compose up -d
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

```bash
cd deployment/kubernetes
kubectl apply -f ./production/
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline is configured to automatically deploy to staging on merge to the `develop` branch, and to production on merge to the `main` branch.

## Configuration

Environment-specific configurations should be placed in the `environments/` directory. These files are used by the deployment scripts to configure the application for specific environments.

## Notes

- Secrets should never be committed to version control
- Use environment variables or secret management services for sensitive information
- Always test deployments in staging before deploying to production
