# Render Services Audit Report

## Services Overview

Based on the configuration files and CLAUDE.md, here are the services that should be deployed on Render:

### Backend Services

1. **ultrai-core** (render.yaml)
   - Status: ❌ INCORRECT - This appears to be an old configuration
   - Build: Uses Poetry (but production should use pip)
   - Issues: 
     - Service name doesn't match what's documented in CLAUDE.md
     - Uses Poetry instead of pip for production
     - Wrong ALLOWED_ORIGINS value

2. **ultrai-staging-api** (render-staging.yaml)
   - Status: ✅ CORRECT
   - URL: https://ultrai-staging-api.onrender.com
   - Build: `pip install -r requirements-production.txt`
   - Frontend: Builds with `npm ci && npm run build`
   - Auto-deploy: YES (from main branch)
   - Issues: None

3. **ultrai-prod-api** (render-production.yaml)
   - Status: ✅ CORRECT
   - URL: https://ultrai-prod-api.onrender.com
   - Build: `pip install -r requirements-production.txt`
   - Frontend: Builds with `npm ci && npm run build`
   - Auto-deploy: NO (manual only)
   - Issues: None

### Frontend Services

According to CLAUDE.md and cursor-rules.md, there should be separate frontend services:

4. **ultrai-staging** (MISSING)
   - Expected URL: https://staging-ultrai.onrender.com
   - Branch: main
   - Should be a static site serving the React app

5. **ultrai-prod** (MISSING)
   - Expected URL: https://ultrai.com
   - Branch: production
   - Should be a static site serving the React app

6. **ultrai-demo** (MISSING)
   - Expected URL: https://demo-ultrai.onrender.com
   - Branch: production
   - Environment: VITE_API_MODE=mock

## Issues Found

### 1. Main render.yaml is outdated
- Service name is `ultrai-core` instead of proper staging/production services
- Uses Poetry which conflicts with production requirements
- Has incorrect configuration

### 2. Missing Frontend Services
- No separate frontend deployments configured
- Frontend is being built and served by backend services
- This doesn't match the architecture described in docs

### 3. Build Command Issues
- Backend services are building frontend (`npm ci && npm run build`)
- This suggests monolithic deployment, not microservices

### 4. Environment Variable Issues
- CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS in staging/production configs don't include frontend URLs
- Missing VITE environment variables for frontend builds

## Recommendations

### 1. Create Frontend Service Configurations

**render-frontend-staging.yaml:**
```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: ultrai-staging
    runtime: static
    plan: free
    buildCommand: npm ci && npm run build
    staticPublishPath: ./dist
    branch: main
    autoDeploy: true
    envVars:
      - key: VITE_APP_MODE
        value: staging
      - key: VITE_API_MODE
        value: live
      - key: VITE_API_URL
        value: https://ultrai-staging-api.onrender.com
```

**render-frontend-production.yaml:**
```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: ultrai-prod
    runtime: static
    plan: free
    buildCommand: npm ci && npm run build
    staticPublishPath: ./dist
    branch: production
    autoDeploy: false
    envVars:
      - key: VITE_APP_MODE
        value: production
      - key: VITE_API_MODE
        value: live
      - key: VITE_API_URL
        value: https://ultrai-prod-api.onrender.com
```

**render-frontend-demo.yaml:**
```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: ultrai-demo
    runtime: static
    plan: free
    buildCommand: npm ci && npm run build
    staticPublishPath: ./dist
    branch: production
    autoDeploy: false
    envVars:
      - key: VITE_APP_MODE
        value: production
      - key: VITE_API_MODE
        value: mock
```

### 2. Update Backend Configurations

Remove frontend build steps from backend services and update CORS:

**For staging:**
```yaml
buildCommand: pip install -r requirements-production.txt
# Remove: cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build && cd ..

envVars:
  - key: CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS
    value: "https://staging-ultrai.onrender.com,http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3009"
```

**For production:**
```yaml
envVars:
  - key: CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS
    value: "https://ultrai.com,https://demo-ultrai.onrender.com"
```

### 3. Remove or Update render.yaml
- Either delete it or update it to be a proper development config
- It's currently causing confusion

### 4. Create Missing Scripts Directory
- Add the `scripts/verify-render-config.sh` script that's referenced in CLAUDE.md

## Current State vs Expected State

### Current:
- 3 backend services (1 incorrect, 2 correct)
- 0 frontend services
- Monolithic deployment (backend serves frontend)

### Expected:
- 2 backend services (staging, production)
- 3 frontend services (staging, production, demo)
- Microservices architecture with separate deployments

## Action Items

1. ❌ Delete or fix `render.yaml`
2. ❌ Create frontend service configurations
3. ❌ Update backend configs to remove frontend builds
4. ❌ Update CORS settings
5. ❌ Create scripts directory with verification script
6. ❌ Update documentation to reflect actual deployment architecture
7. ❌ Add proper environment variables for frontend builds
