# Staging Environment Status Report
**Date**: 2025-01-14  
**Environment**: https://ultrai-staging-api.onrender.com

## Summary
✅ Staging is deployed and running  
⚠️ Health shows "degraded" status due to LLM service  
✅ Models are correctly listed as available  
❌ Some expected endpoints return 404/405 errors  

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Health Check ✅
```
GET /api/health
Status: 200 OK
```
- **Status**: degraded
- **Uptime**: ~10 minutes (recently deployed)
- **Services**:
  - Database: ✅ healthy
  - Cache: ✅ healthy
  - LLM: ⚠️ degraded

### 2. Model Availability ✅
```
GET /api/available-models
Status: 200 OK
```
- Successfully returns list of 20+ models
- Models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google all listed
- Models show status: "available"
- Our fix for model detection appears to be working!

### 3. Missing/Changed Endpoints ❌
The following endpoints are not responding as expected:
- `/api/models` → 404 (should use `/api/available-models`)
- `/api/model-health` → 404
- `/api/orchestrate` → 405 (Method Not Allowed)

### 4. Potential Issues

1. **Route Misalignment**: The routes in staging don't match what's documented
2. **LLM Service Degraded**: Despite models showing as available, health check reports degraded
3. **Orchestration Not Accessible**: Main functionality endpoint returns 405

## Next Steps

1. **Check Route Configuration**:
   - Review `app/routes/__init__.py` or main app file
   - Ensure all routes are properly registered
   - Check if route prefixes changed

2. **Investigate LLM Degradation**:
   - Check logs for specific errors
   - Verify API keys are set in Render dashboard
   - Test individual model providers

3. **Fix Orchestration Endpoint**:
   - Verify correct HTTP method (POST should work)
   - Check if authentication is required
   - Review route implementation

## Conclusion

The staging deployment is partially successful:
- ✅ Basic infrastructure is running
- ✅ Model availability fix is working
- ❌ Core orchestration functionality needs investigation
- ❌ Several endpoints are missing or misconfigured

The deployment needs further debugging before it's fully functional.
