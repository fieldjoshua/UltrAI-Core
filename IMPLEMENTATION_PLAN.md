# ULTRAI IMPLEMENTATION PLAN - PHASE 1

This document outlines the detailed steps to implement Phase 1 of our refactoring roadmap.

## Progress to Date

✅ `.env.example` updated to include all necessary environment variables
✅ Created `CONTRIBUTING.md` to standardize code style and linting
✅ Created `Makefile` to consolidate scripts and commands
✅ Fixed linting issues in `ultra_analysis_patterns.py` and `ultra_error_handling.py`
✅ Created CI workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
✅ Removed all `.DS_Store` files from the repository
✅ Created `MODULARIZATION_PLAN.md` for Phase 2 backend refactoring
✅ Created directory for archiving older components (`NEWArchive/components/`)

## Remaining Tasks for Phase 1

### 1. Environment Variable Cleanup

- [ ] Remove redundant environment files:
  - [ ] `.env.backup` (after confirming it's not needed)
  - [ ] `.env .notepad` (after confirming it's not needed)
  - [ ] `.env.example.notepad` (after confirming it's not needed)
  - [ ] `.env-val` (after preserving any unique values)

- [ ] Update main `.env` file to match the new format

### 2. Remove/Archive Redundant Files

- [ ] Consolidate AnimatedLogo files:
  - [ ] Determine which version of AnimatedLogo is currently in use (V3 appears to be used in UltraWithDocuments.tsx)
  - [ ] Move older versions to `NEWArchive/components/`

- [ ] Consolidate debug files:
  - [ ] Determine if both `debug.py` and `debug2.py` are needed
  - [ ] Move unnecessary ones to `NEWArchive/examples/`

- [x] Clean up DS_Store files:
  - [x] Remove all `.DS_Store` files from the repository
  - [x] Ensure `.gitignore` properly excludes them

### 3. Fix Immediate Linting Issues

- [ ] Fix linting issues in remaining Python files:
  - [ ] Run `black` and `isort` on backend Python files
  - [ ] Prioritize files in the backend directory

- [ ] Fix linting issues in TypeScript/JavaScript files:
  - [ ] Run ESLint and Prettier on frontend code

### 4. Set up CI Environment

- [x] Create a basic CI workflow in `.github/workflows/`:
  - [x] Create `ci.yml` file for running tests and linting
  - [x] Include steps for Python and JavaScript linting
  - [x] Add basic test runs for both frontend and backend

## Implementation Order

1. Start with cleaning up environment variables (most urgent, to prevent secrets leaks)
2. Remove redundant files (quick wins, declutters the workspace)
3. Fix linting issues (improves code quality across the board)
4. Set up CI (ensures future code follows standards)

## Testing Plan

After each change, verify:

1. The application still runs locally
2. Tests pass
3. No unexpected errors appear in the logs

Run these tests using the new Makefile commands (`make run`, `make test`, etc.)
