# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Memory Guidance

- do not ask me for any api keys. if there is a problem, fix it

## Development Commands

### Quick Start
```bash
make setup                # Initial setup (install deps + build frontend)
make dev                  # Start development server (fast, minimal deps)
make prod                 # Start production server (full features)
source venv/bin/activate  # CRITICAL: Activate virtual environment before Python commands
```
