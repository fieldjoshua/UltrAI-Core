## Critical Development Rules (from .cursorrc)

### Documentation-First Approach
**ALWAYS** review relevant documentation before suggesting changes:
- `documentation/CORE_README.md` - Core system documentation
- `documentation/guidelines/DOCUMENTATION_FIRST.md` - Documentation requirements
- `documentation/instructions/PATTERNS.md` - Required patterns for implementation
- `documentation/logic/INTELLIGENCE_MULTIPLICATION.md` - Core system logic

### No Duplication Rule
Before creating any new functionality:
1. Search for existing implementations using Grep/Glob tools
2. Check hooks/ directory for reusable state logic
3. Components must use existing hooks instead of reimplementing
4. Files with the same name in different directories are forbidden

## Architecture Overview

### Core Application Structure

**FastAPI Backend** (`app/`) - Production-ready API with dependency injection pattern:
- `main.py` - Application factory with service initialization
- `app.py` - Core FastAPI app configuration
- `config.py` - Environment-based configuration management

**Service Layer** (`app/services/`) - Business logic with clear separation:
- `orchestration_service.py` - Main LLM orchestration controller
- `model_registry.py` - Dynamic model registration and management
- `prompt_service.py` - Prompt templates and processing
- `quality_evaluation.py` - Response quality assessment
- `llm_adapters.py` - Unified interface for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google APIs

**LLM Adapter Pattern**: All external LLM providers use a shared `httpx.AsyncClient` with 25-second timeout to prevent hanging requests. Each adapter (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, HuggingFace) implements provider-specific API requirements while maintaining consistent interface.

**Routes Layer** (`app/routes/`) - FastAPI route handlers that validate input and delegate to services:
- `orchestrator_minimal.py` - Core multi-model orchestration endpoint
- `health_routes.py` - System health monitoring
- `available_models_routes.py` - Dynamic model discovery

**Models Layer** (`app/models/`) - Pydantic models for API validation and SQLAlchemy models for database

**Ultra Synthesisâ„¢ Pipeline**: Three-stage orchestration process:
1. `initial_response` - Multi-model parallel analysis
2. `peer_review_and_revision` - Cross-model review and refinement  
3. `ultra_synthesis` - Final comprehensive synthesis using lead LLM approach

### Frontend Architecture

**React + TypeScript** (`frontend/`) with modern tooling:
- Vite build system with hot reload and ESM support
- TailwindCSS + Radix UI components (modular design system)
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- React Router for SPA navigation
- Production API URL: `https://ultrai-core.onrender.com`

**Key Frontend Features**:
- `MultimodalAnalysis` component - Main orchestrator interface
- `DocumentsPage` - Document upload and analysis
- `OrchestratorPage` - Multi-model selection and execution
- Error boundaries with `ErrorFallback` for graceful error handling

## AICheck Integration

Follow `.aicheck/RULES.md` requirements with focus on **deployment verification**:

### Core Commands
- `./aicheck status` - Check current action and system status
- `./aicheck new ActionName` - Create new action
- `./aicheck ACTIVE ActionName` - Set active action (only one can be active)
- `./aicheck complete` - Complete active action with dependency verification
- `./aicheck deploy` - Pre-deployment validation
- `./aicheck focus` - Check for scope creep
- `./aicheck stuck` - Get help when confused

### Critical Deployment Rule
**NO ACTION IS COMPLETE WITHOUT PRODUCTION VERIFICATION**. All work must be tested on the actual production URL (`https://ultrai-core.onrender.com`) with documented evidence before marking actions complete.

### Mandatory Workflow Rules
1. **Only ONE active action per session** - Use `./aicheck ACTIVE ActionName` to set active action
2. **Test-Driven Development** - Write tests before implementation
3. **Documentation-First** - All plans must be documented in action directories before coding
4. **Production Verification Required** - Every completion requires live production testing
5. **Git Integration** - Actions track git commits and require clean working directory

## Development Workflow

### Service Dependencies and Application Factory
Services use dependency injection pattern with centralized initialization in `main.py`:

```python
def initialize_services() -> Dict[str, Any]:
    model_registry = ModelRegistry()
    quality_evaluator = QualityEvaluationService()
    rate_limiter = RateLimiter()
    
    orchestration_service = OrchestrationService(
        model_registry=model_registry,
        quality_evaluator=quality_evaluator,
        rate_limiter=rate_limiter,
    )
    
    prompt_service = get_prompt_service(
        model_registry=model_registry, 
        orchestration_service=orchestration_service
    )
    
    return {"model_registry": model_registry, "prompt_service": prompt_service, "orchestration_service": orchestration_service}
```

**Critical Architecture Patterns**:
- **Dependency Injection**: Services initialized in `main.py` and passed to routes
- **Shared HTTP Client**: All LLM adapters use single `httpx.AsyncClient` with 25s timeout
- **Graceful Degradation**: Optional services (database, cache) fail gracefully when unavailable
- **Environment-Based Configuration**: Dev vs prod modes control feature availability

### Adding New Features
1. Create route handler in `app/routes/`
2. Implement business logic in `app/services/`
3. Add Pydantic models in `app/models/`
4. Write tests with appropriate markers (`unit`, `integration`, `e2e`)
5. Test locally with `make dev` or `make prod`
6. Deploy and verify in production before completion

### Environment Configuration
**Development vs Production Modes**:
- `make dev` - Minimal dependencies, no database/auth required, fast startup
- `make prod` - Full features with PostgreSQL, Redis, authentication

**Configuration Management** (`app/config.py`):
- Environment variables control feature flags (ENABLE_CACHE, ENABLE_AUTH, ENABLE_RATE_LIMIT)
- LLM API keys: OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GOOGLE_API_KEY, HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY
- Mock mode available via USE_MOCK/MOCK_MODE environment variables

**Key Configuration Patterns**:
- Services gracefully degrade when optional dependencies unavailable
- Rate limiter auto-registers new models dynamically
- Frontend served as static files from `/frontend/dist/` when built

**Application Entry Points**:
- `app_development.py` - Development entry point (minimal deps, fast startup)
- `app_production.py` - Production entry point used by Render
- `app/main.py` - Application factory with service initialization
- `app/app.py` - FastAPI app configuration and route mounting

## Testing Strategy

**Pytest Configuration** (`pytest.ini`):
- Async test support with `asyncio_mode = auto`
- Test markers: `unit`, `integration`, `e2e`, `production`, `slow`, `quick`
- 60-second timeout for long-running tests
- Coverage reporting excludes test files

**Test Organization**:
- `tests/unit/` - Fast, isolated unit tests
- `tests/integration/` - Service integration tests
- `tests/e2e/` - End-to-end workflow tests
- `tests/live/` - Live tests against real LLM providers and production URLs

**Live Testing Strategy**:
- Tests marked `@pytest.mark.live_online` use real LLM providers and production endpoints
- `./run_e2e.sh` runs Playwright tests using local Chrome installation to avoid CDN downloads
- Live tests randomly select from diverse prompts to exercise different knowledge domains

## Production Deployment

**Platform**: Render.com
- Repository: Auto-deploys from `main` branch pushes
- Service: `ultrai-core`
- URL: `https://ultrai-core.onrender.com`
- Configuration: `render.yaml` (may be overridden by dashboard settings)

**Deployment Process**:
1. Use `make deploy` to commit and push changes
2. Monitor build in Render dashboard
3. Test production endpoints before marking work complete
4. Document verification results in `supporting_docs/`

## API Architecture

**Core Orchestration Endpoint**:
- `POST /api/orchestrator/analyze` - Main multi-model analysis
- Request: `{"query": "...", "selected_models": ["gpt-4", "claude-3"], "options": {...}}`
- Response: Multi-stage pipeline results (initial_response, meta_analysis, ultra_synthesis)

**Health Monitoring**:
- `GET /health` - Overall system health
- `GET /api/orchestrator/health` - Orchestrator service health
- `GET /api/metrics` - Prometheus metrics

**Model Integration**:
- Dynamic model registry supports runtime model addition
- Unified adapter pattern for all LLM providers
- Automatic rate limiting and timeout handling (25-second max per request)

## Architecture Principles (from .cursor/rules)

**Route Responsibility**: Routes in `app/routes/` are the "front door" - they validate requests with Pydantic models and delegate to services. They should not contain business logic.

**Service Layer Logic**: `app/services/` contains the application brain:
- `orchestration_service.py` - Core multi-step analysis controller
- `prompt_service.py` - Main orchestrator controller (being refactored)
- `llm_adapters.py` - Critical bridge to external LLM APIs

**LLM Adapter Architecture**:
- All adapters inherit from `BaseAdapter` requiring `api_key` and `model`
- Shared `httpx.AsyncClient` with 25-second timeout solves hanging request issues
- Provider-specific payload construction (OpenAI chat format, Anthropic messages, Gemini contents)
- Consistent error handling and response parsing across all providers

**Data Models**: `app/models/` defines application vocabulary through Pydantic (API validation) and SQLAlchemy (database) models

**Middleware**: `app/middleware/` handles cross-cutting concerns (auth, CSRF, security headers) for every request/response

## Key Development Patterns

### Error Handling Strategy
- All LLM adapters inherit from `BaseAdapter` with consistent error handling
- Services return structured responses with error details
- Frontend uses error boundaries (`ErrorFallback`) for graceful degradation

### Testing Strategy Integration
- Use test markers: `@pytest.mark.unit`, `@pytest.mark.integration`, `@pytest.mark.e2e`
- Async tests auto-detected with `asyncio_mode = auto` in pytest.ini
- Production verification required before completing any deployment-related work

### Mock Development Mode
- `USE_MOCK=true` enables mock responses for development without API keys
- All services support mock mode for faster development iteration
- Mock responses maintained in service implementations

## Ultra Synthesisâ„¢ Prompt Configuration

The Ultra Synthesisâ„¢ prompt can be configured for different output styles:

**Default (Streamlined)**:
```python
synthesis_prompt = f"""Given the user's initial query, please review the revised drafts from all LLMs. Keep commentary to a minimum unless it helps with the original inquiry. Do not reference the process, but produce the best, most thorough answer to the original query. Include process analysis only if helpful. Do not omit ANY relevant data from the other models.

ORIGINAL QUERY: {original_prompt}

REVISED LLM DRAFTS:
{meta_analysis}

Create a comprehensive Ultra Synthesisâ„¢ document that:
- Directly answers the original query with maximum thoroughness
- Integrates ALL relevant information from every model's response
- Adds analytical insights only where they enhance understanding
- Presents the most complete, actionable answer possible

Begin with the ultra synthesis document."""
```

**API Response Options**:
- `include_pipeline_details: false` (default) - Returns only Ultra Synthesis result
- `include_pipeline_details: true` - Returns all pipeline stages for debugging
