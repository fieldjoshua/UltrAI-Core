# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## AICheck Integration

Claude should follow the rules specified in `.aicheck/RULES.md` and use AICheck commands:

- `./aicheck action new ActionName` - Create a new action 
- `./aicheck action set ActionName` - Set the current active action
- `./aicheck action complete [ActionName]` - Complete an action with dependency verification
- `./aicheck exec` - Toggle exec mode for system maintenance
- `./aicheck status` - Show the current action status
- `./aicheck dependency add NAME VERSION JUSTIFICATION [ACTION]` - Add external dependency
- `./aicheck dependency internal DEP_ACTION ACTION TYPE [DESCRIPTION]` - Add internal dependency

## Project Rules

Claude should follow the rules specified in `.aicheck/RULES.md` with focus on documentation-first approach and adherence to language-specific best practices.

## AICheck Procedures

1. Always check the current action with `./aicheck status` at the start of a session
2. Follow the active action's plan when implementing
3. Create tests before implementation code
4. Document all Claude interactions in supporting_docs/claude-interactions/
5. Only work within the scope of the active action
6. Document all dependencies before completing an action
7. Immediately respond to git hook suggestions before continuing work
8. Manage todo.md files in action directories using native todo functions

## Todo Management Integration

### Todo File Requirements
- Every action directory MUST contain a todo.md file for task tracking
- Use TodoWrite/TodoRead functions to manage action-specific todo files
- Tasks should align with action plan phases and success criteria
- Todo status integrates with overall action progress tracking

### Todo Workflow
- Create todo.md when starting a new action (use TODO_TEMPLATE.md)
- Derive tasks from action plan phases and requirements
- Use TodoWrite to update task status as work progresses
- Mark tasks as in_progress when actively working on them
- Complete tasks immediately after finishing work
- Keep comprehensive notes about dependencies and progress

## Dependency Management

When adding external libraries or frameworks:
1. Document with `./aicheck dependency add NAME VERSION JUSTIFICATION`
2. Include specific version requirements
3. Provide clear justification for adding the dependency

When creating dependencies between actions:
1. Document with `./aicheck dependency internal DEP_ACTION ACTION TYPE DESCRIPTION`
2. Specify the type of dependency (data, function, service, etc.)
3. Add detailed description of the dependency relationship

## Claude Workflow

When the user requests work:
1. Check if it fits within the current action (if not, suggest creating a new action)
2. Consult the action plan for guidance
3. Follow test-driven development practices
4. Document your thought process
5. Document all dependencies
6. Implement according to the plan
7. Verify your implementation against the success criteria
