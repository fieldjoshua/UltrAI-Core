# Services

This directory contains service implementations that provide higher-level functionality built on top of the orchestration and adapter systems.

## Planned Services

- `orchestration_service.py` - Service for managing orchestrators
- `analysis_service.py` - Service for performing various types of analysis
- `document_service.py` - Service for processing and analyzing documents
- `cache_service.py` - Service for caching and retrieving responses

## Architecture

Services are designed to:

1. Provide a clean API for application code
2. Manage resources and configurations
3. Coordinate between multiple components
4. Handle cross-cutting concerns

## Usage Example

```python
from src.services.orchestration_service import OrchestrationService

# Initialize service
service = OrchestrationService()

# Use service methods
response = service.analyze_text(
    text="Analyze this text for sentiment and key points",
    models=["openai:gpt-4", "anthropic:claude-3-opus"],
    analysis_type="comprehensive"
)

# Extract results
print(f"Primary response: {response.content}")
print(f"Sentiment: {response.metadata.get('sentiment')}")
print(f"Key points: {response.metadata.get('key_points')}")
```

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing services:

1. Use dependency injection for components like adapters and orchestrators
2. Implement proper error handling and logging
3. Consider caching strategies for expensive operations
4. Use async patterns for I/O bound operations
5. Provide both synchronous and asynchronous APIs when appropriate
