Title: UltrLLMOrchestrator System (UltrAI)
Cross-Reference to Related Applications
[Not Applicable]
Field of the Invention
This invention relates generally to artificial intelligence systems, and more particularly to a system and method for orchestrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) through structured analysis patterns to generate enhanced insights.
Background of the Invention
Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for natural language processing and generation. However, individual LLMs often have limitations in terms of reliability, depth of analysis, and susceptibility to biases. Current approaches typically utilize a single LLM to respond to user queries, which fails to leverage the potential benefits of combining multiple models with different capabilities and training methodologies. Additionally, existing LLM implementations lack structured analytical frameworks that guide these models through complex reasoning processes.
There exists a need for an advanced system that can effectively orchestrate multiple LLMs through defined analytical patterns, leverage document context intelligently, and synthesize insights in a manner that enhances the quality, depth, and reliability of the generated outputs.
Summary of the Invention
The present invention, UltrAI, is an advanced AI analysis platform designed to enhance the quality, depth, and reliability of insights generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). It functions as a web service that accepts user prompts and optional contextual documents, orchestrating multiple user-selected LLMs through predefined, multi-stage "Analysis Patterns." These patterns guide the LLMs through structured processes like critique, fact-checking, perspective-taking, or confidence scoring, culminating in a synthesized final output generated by a designated "Ultra" LLM.
The system's architecture comprises a frontend interface for user interactions, a sophisticated backend that handles orchestration logic, document processing capabilities, and integrated pricing mechanisms. The core innovation lies in the Pattern-Based Multi-LLM Orchestration methodology, which utilizes structured analysis patterns with sequential processing stages and pattern-specific prompt templates to direct the flow of information across multiple models.

Abstract
The UltrLLMOrchestrator System (UltrAI) is an advanced AI analysis platform that enhances the quality, depth, and reliability of insights generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). The system orchestrates multiple user-selected LLMs through predefined, multi-stage "Analysis Patterns" to guide structured analytical processes. Each pattern implements unique workflows with sequential processing stages and pattern-specific prompt templates. The system includes document processing capabilities for contextual analysis, an "Ultra" LLM synthesis stage, and integrated pricing mechanisms with tiered structure and token efficiency considerations. The web-based implementation features a React frontend and FastAPI backend with comprehensive user interface elements for prompt input, document management, model selection, and result visualization.
